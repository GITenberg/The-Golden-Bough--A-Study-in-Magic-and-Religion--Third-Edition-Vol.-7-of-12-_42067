        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the last part
        of this work we examined the figure of the Dying and Reviving God as
        it appears in the Oriental religions of classical antiquity. With the
        present instalment of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Golden Bough</span></span> we pursue the
        same theme in other religions and among other races. Passing from the
        East to Europe we begin with the religion of ancient Greece, which
        embodies the now familiar conception in two typical examples, the
        vine-god Dionysus and the corn-goddess Persephone, with her mother
        and duplicate Demeter. Both of these Greek divinities are
        personifications of cultivated plants, and a consideration of them
        naturally leads us on to investigate similar personifications
        elsewhere. Now of all the plants which men have artificially reared
        for the sake of food the cereals are on the whole the most important;
        therefore it is natural that the religion of primitive agricultural
        communities should be deeply coloured by the principal occupation of
        their lives, the care of the corn. Hence the frequency with which the
        figures of the Corn-mother and Corn-maiden, answering to the Demeter
        and Persephone of ancient Greece, meet us in other parts of the
        world, and not least of all on the harvest-fields of modern Europe.
        But edible roots as well as cereals have been cultivated by many
        races, especially in the tropical regions, as a subsidiary or even as
        a principal means of subsistence; and accordingly they too enter
        largely into the religious ideas of the peoples who live by them. Yet
        in the case of the roots, such as yams, taro, and potatoes,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id=
        "Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the conception of the Dying and
        Reviving God appears to figure less prominently than in the case of
        the cereals, perhaps for the simple reason that while the growth and
        decay of the one sort of fruit go on above ground for all to see, the
        similar processes of the other are hidden under ground and therefore
        strike the popular imagination less forcibly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having surveyed
        the variations of our main theme among the agricultural races of
        mankind, we prosecute the enquiry among savages who remain more or
        less completely in the hunting, fishing, and pastoral stages of
        society. The same motive which leads the primitive husbandman to
        adore the corn or the roots, induces the primitive hunter, fowler,
        fisher, or herdsman to adore the beasts, birds, or fishes which
        furnish him with the means of subsistence. To him the conception of
        the death of these worshipful beings is naturally presented with
        singular force and distinctness; since it is no figurative or
        allegorical death, no poetical embroidery thrown over the skeleton,
        but the real death, the naked skeleton, that constantly thrusts
        itself importunately on his attention. And strange as it may seem to
        us civilised men, the notion of the immortality and even of the
        resurrection of the lower animals appears to be almost as familiar to
        the savage and to be accepted by him with nearly as unwavering a
        faith as the obvious fact of their death and destruction. For the
        most part he assumes as a matter of course that the souls of dead
        animals survive their decease; hence much of the thought of the
        savage hunter is devoted to the problem of how he can best appease
        the naturally incensed ghosts of his victims so as to prevent them
        from doing him a mischief. This refusal of the savage to recognise in
        death a final cessation of the vital process, this unquestioning
        faith in the unbroken continuity of all life, is a fact that has not
        yet received the attention which it seems to merit from enquirers
        into the constitution of the human mind as well as into the history
        of religion. In the following pages I have collected <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> examples of this curious faith; I must
        leave it to others to appraise them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus on the whole
        we are concerned in these volumes with the reverence or worship paid
        by men to the natural resources from which they draw their nutriment,
        both vegetable and animal. That they should invest these resources
        with an atmosphere of wonder and awe, often indeed with a halo of
        divinity, is no matter for surprise. The circle of human knowledge,
        illuminated by the pale cold light of reason, is so infinitesimally
        small, the dark regions of human ignorance which lie beyond that
        luminous ring are so immeasurably vast, that imagination is fain to
        step up to the border line and send the warm, richly coloured beams
        of her fairy lantern streaming out into the darkness; and so, peering
        into the gloom, she is apt to mistake the shadowy reflections of her
        own figure for real beings moving in the abyss. In short, few men are
        sensible of the sharp line that divides the known from the unknown;
        to most men it is a hazy borderland where perception and conception
        melt indissolubly into one. Hence to the savage the ghosts of dead
        animals and men, with which his imagination peoples the void, are
        hardly less real than the solid shapes which the living animals and
        men present to his senses; and his thoughts and activities are nearly
        as much absorbed by the one as by the other. Of him it may be said
        with perhaps even greater truth than of his civilised brother,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What shadows we are, and what shadows we
        pursue!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But having said so
        much in this book of the misty glory which the human imagination
        sheds round the hard material realities of the food supply, I am
        unwilling to leave my readers under the impression, natural but
        erroneous, that man has created most of his gods out of his belly.
        That is not so, at least that is not my reading of the history of
        religion. Among the visible, tangible, perceptible elements by which
        he is surrounded—and it is only of these that I <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id=
        "Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> presume to speak—there are
        others than the merely nutritious which have exerted a powerful
        influence in touching his imagination and stimulating his energies,
        and so have contributed to build up the complex fabric of religion.
        To the preservation of the species the reproductive faculties are no
        less essential than the nutritive; and with them we enter on a very
        different sphere of thought and feeling, to wit, the relation of the
        sexes to each other, with all the depths of tenderness and all the
        intricate problems which that mysterious relation involves. The study
        of the various forms, some gross and palpable, some subtle and
        elusive, in which the sexual instinct has moulded the religious
        consciousness of our race, is one of the most interesting, as it is
        one of the most difficult and delicate tasks, which await the future
        historian of religion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the influence
        which the sexes exert on each other, intimate and profound as it has
        been and must always be, is far indeed from exhausting the forces of
        attraction by which mankind are bound together in society. The need
        of mutual protection, the economic advantages of co-operation, the
        contagion of example, the communication of knowledge, the great ideas
        that radiate from great minds, like shafts of light from high
        towers,—these and many other things combine to draw men into
        communities, to drill them into regiments, and to set them marching
        on the road of progress with a concentrated force to which the loose
        skirmishers of mere anarchy and individualism can never hope to
        oppose a permanent resistance. Hence when we consider how intimately
        humanity depends on society for many of the boons which it prizes
        most highly, we shall probably admit that of all the forces open to
        our observation which have shaped human destiny the influence of man
        on man is by far the greatest. If that is so, it seems to follow that
        among the beings, real or imaginary, which the religious imagination
        has clothed with the attributes of divinity, human spirits are
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id=
        "Pgix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> likely to play a more important
        part than the spirits of plants, animals, or inanimate objects. I
        believe that a careful examination of the evidence, which has still
        to be undertaken, will confirm this conclusion; and that if we could
        strictly interrogate the phantoms which the human mind has conjured
        up out of the depths of its bottomless ignorance and enshrined as
        deities in the dim light of temples, we should find that the majority
        of them have been nothing but the ghosts of dead men. However, to say
        this is necessarily to anticipate the result of future research; and
        if in saying it I have ventured to make a prediction, which like all
        predictions is liable to be falsified by the event, I have done so
        only from a fear lest, without some such warning, the numerous facts
        recorded in these volumes might lend themselves to an exaggerated
        estimate of their own importance and hence to a misinterpretation and
        distortion of history.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
        part of this work we saw that in antiquity the civilised nations of
        western Asia and Egypt pictured to themselves the changes of the
        seasons, and particularly the annual growth and decay of vegetation,
        as episodes in the life of gods, whose mournful death and happy
        resurrection they celebrated with dramatic rites of alternate
        lamentation and rejoicing. But if the celebration was in form
        dramatic, it was in substance magical; that is to say, it was
        intended, on the principles of sympathetic magic, to ensure the
        vernal regeneration of plants and the multiplication of animals,
        which had seemed to be menaced by the inroads of winter. In the
        ancient world, however, such ideas and such rites were by no means
        confined to the Oriental peoples of Babylon and Syria, of Phrygia and
        Egypt; they were not a product peculiar to the religious mysticism of
        the dreamy East, but were shared by the races of livelier fancy and
        more mercurial temperament who inhabited the shores and islands of
        the Aegean. We need not, with some enquirers in ancient and modern
        times, suppose that these Western peoples borrowed from the older
        civilisation of the Orient the conception of the Dying and Reviving
        God, together with the solemn ritual, in which that conception was
        dramatically set forth before the eyes of the worshippers. More
        probably the resemblance which may be traced in this respect between
        the religions of the East and the West is no more than what we
        commonly, though incorrectly, call a fortuitous coincidence, the
        effect of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg
        002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        similar causes acting alike on the similar constitution of the human
        mind in different countries and under different skies. The Greek had
        no need to journey into far countries to learn the vicissitudes of
        the seasons, to mark the fleeting beauty of the damask rose, the
        transient glory of the golden corn, the passing splendour of the
        purple grapes. Year by year in his own beautiful land he beheld, with
        natural regret, the bright pomp of summer fading into the gloom and
        stagnation of winter, and year by year he hailed with natural delight
        the outburst of fresh life in spring. Accustomed to personify the
        forces of nature, to tinge her cold abstractions with the warm hues
        of imagination, to clothe her naked realities with the gorgeous
        drapery of a mythic fancy, he fashioned for himself a train of gods
        and goddesses, of spirits and elves, out of the shifting panorama of
        the seasons, and followed the annual fluctuations of their fortunes
        with alternate emotions of cheerfulness and dejection, of gladness
        and sorrow, which found their natural expression in alternate rites
        of rejoicing and lamentation, of revelry and mourning. A
        consideration of some of the Greek divinities who thus died and rose
        again from the dead may furnish us with a series of companion
        pictures to set side by side with the sad figures of Adonis, Attis,
        and Osiris. We begin with Dionysus.</p>

        mystic doctrines and extravagant rites were essentially foreign to
        the clear intelligence and sober temperament of the Greek race. Yet
        appealing as it did to that love of mystery and that proneness to
        revert to savagery which seem to be innate in most men, the religion
        spread like wildfire through Greece until the god whom Homer hardly
        deigned to notice had become the most popular figure of the pantheon.
        The resemblance which his story and his ceremonies present to those
        of Osiris have led some enquirers both in ancient and modern times to
        hold that Dionysus was merely a disguised Osiris, imported directly

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, there are
        indications, few but significant, that Dionysus was conceived as a
        deity of agriculture and the corn. He is spoken of as himself doing
        the work of a husbandman:<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href=
        "#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> he is
        reported to have been the first to yoke oxen to the plough, which
        before had been dragged by hand alone; and some people found in this
        tradition the clue to the bovine shape in which, as we shall see, the
        god was often supposed to present himself to his worshippers. Thus
        guiding the ploughshare and scattering the seed as he went, Dionysus
        is said to have eased the labour of the husbandman.<a id="noteref_23"
        name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> Further,
        we are told that in the land of the Bisaltae, a Thracian tribe, there
        was a great and fair sanctuary of Dionysus, where at his festival a
        bright light shone forth at night as a token of an abundant harvest
        vouchsafed by the deity; but if the crops were to fail that year, the
        mystic light was not seen, darkness brooded over the sanctuary as at
        other times.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>
        Moreover, among the emblems of Dionysus was the winnowing-fan, that
        is the large open shovel-shaped basket, which down to modern times
        has been used by farmers to separate the grain from the chaff by
        tossing the corn in the air. This simple agricultural instrument
        figured in the mystic rites of Dionysus; indeed the god is
        traditionally said to have been placed at birth in a winnowing-fan as
        in a cradle: in art he is represented as an infant so cradled; and
        from these traditions and representations he derived the epithet of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first sight
        this symbolism might be explained very simply and naturally by
        supposing that the divine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
        006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        infant cradled in the winnowing-fan was identified with the corn
        which it is the function of the instrument to winnow and sift. Yet
        against this identification it may be urged with reason that the use
        of a winnowing-fan as a cradle was not peculiar to Dionysus; it was a
        regular practice with the ancient Greeks to place their infants in
        winnowing-fans as an omen of wealth and fertility for the future life
        of the children.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> Customs
        of the same sort have been observed, apparently for similar reasons,
        by other peoples in other lands. For example, in Java it is or used
        to be customary to place every child at birth in a bamboo basket like
        the sieve or winnowing-basket which Javanese farmers use for
        separating the rice from the chaff.<a id="noteref_27" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> It is
        the midwife who places the child in the basket, and as she does so
        she suddenly knocks with the palms of both hands on the basket in
        order that the child may not be timid and fearful. Then she addresses
        the child thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Cry not, for Njaï-among and
        Kaki-among”</span> (two spirits) <span class="tei tei-q">“are
        watching over you.”</span> Next she addresses these two spirits,
        saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bring not your grandchild to the
        road, lest he be trampled by a horse; bring him not to the bank of
        the river, lest he fall into the river.”</span> The object of the
        ceremony is said to be that these two spirits should always and
        everywhere guard the child.<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href=
        "#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        first anniversary of a child's birthday the Chinese of Foo-Chow set
        the little one in a large bamboo sieve, such as farmers employ in
        winnowing grain, and in the sieve they place along with the child a
        variety of articles, such as fruits, gold or silver ornaments, a set
        of money-scales, books, a pencil, pen, ink, paper, and so on, and
        they draw omens of the child's future career from the object which it
        first handles and plays with. Thus, if the infant first grasps the
        money-scale, he will be wealthy; if he seizes on a book, he will be
        learned, and so forth.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=

        007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        India it is customary for well-to-do people to place a newborn infant
        in a winnowing-fan filled with rice and afterwards to give the grain
        to the nurse in attendance.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href=

        Egypt a newly-born babe is immediately laid upon a corn-sieve and
        corn is scattered around it; moreover, on the seventh day after birth
        the infant is carried on a sieve through the whole house, while the
        midwife scatters wheat, barley, pease and salt. The intention of
        these ceremonies is said to be to avert evil spirits from the
        child,<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href=
        "#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> and a
        like motive is assigned by other peoples for the practice of placing
        newborn infants in a winnowing-basket or corn-sieve. For example, in
        the Punjaub, when several children of a family have died in
        succession, a new baby will sometimes be put at birth into an old
        winnowing-basket (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chhaj</span></span>) along with the sweepings of
        the house, and so dragged out into the yard; such a child may, like
        Dionysus, in after life be known by the name of Winnowing-basket
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Chhajju</span></span>) or Dragged (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ghasitâ</span></span>).<a id="noteref_32" name=
        "noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> The
        object of treating the child in this way seems to be to save its life
        by deceiving the spirits, who are supposed to have carried off its
        elder brothers and sisters; these malevolent beings are on the
        look-out for the new baby, but they will never think of raking for it
        in the dust-bin, that being the last place where they would expect to
        find the hope of the family. The same may perhaps be the intention of
        a ceremony observed by the Gaolis of the Deccan. As soon as a child
        is born, it is bathed and then placed on a sieve for a few minutes.
        On the fifth day the sieve, with a lime and <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pan</span></span>
        leaves on it, is removed outside the house and then, after the
        worship of Chetti has been performed, the sieve is thrown away on the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008"
        id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> road.<a id="noteref_33" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> Again,
        the same notion of rescuing the child from dangerous spirits comes
        out very clearly in a similar custom observed by the natives of Laos,
        a province of Siam. These people <span class="tei tei-q">“believe
        that an infant is the child, not of its parents, but of the spirits,
        and in this belief they go through the following formalities. As soon
        as an infant is born it is bathed and dressed, laid upon a
        rice-sieve, and placed—by the grandmother if present, if not, by the
        next near female relative—at the head of the stairs or of the ladder
        leading to the house. The person performing this duty calls out in a
        loud tone to the spirits to come and take the child away to-day, or
        for ever after to let it alone; at the same moment she stamps
        violently on the floor to frighten the child, or give it a jerk, and
        make it cry. If it does not cry this is regarded as an evil omen. If,
        on the other hand, it follows the ordinary laws of nature and begins
        to exercise its vocal organs, it is supposed to have a happy and
        prosperous life before it. Sometimes the spirits do come and take the
        infant away, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> it dies before it is
        twenty-four hours old, but, to prevent such a calamity, strings are
        tied round its wrists on the first night after its birth, and if it
        sickens or is feeble the spirit-doctors are called in to prescribe
        certain offerings to be made to keep away the very spirits who, only
        a few hours previously, were ceremoniously called upon to come and
        carry the child off. On the day after its birth the child is regarded
        as being the property no longer of the spirits, who could have taken
        it if they had wanted it, but of the parents, who forthwith sell it
        to some relation for a nominal sum—an eighth or a quarter of a rupee
        perhaps. This again is a further guarantee against molestation by the
        spirits, who apparently are regarded as honest folk that would not
        stoop to take what has been bought and paid for.”</span><a id=

        among the Tanala people of Madagascar almost all children born in the
        unlucky month of Faosa are buried alive in the forest. But if the
        parents resolve to let the child live, they must call in the aid of a
        diviner, who performs a ceremony for averting the threatened
        ill-luck. The child is placed in a winnowing-fan along with certain
        herbs. Further, the diviner takes herbs of the same sort, a worn-out
        spade, and an axe, fastens them to the father's spear, and sets the
        spear up in the ground. Then the child is bathed in water which has
        been medicated with some of the same herbs. Finally the diviner says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The worn-out spade to the grandchild; may it
        (the child) not despoil its father, may it not despoil its mother,
        may it not despoil the children; let it be good.”</span> This
        ceremony, we are told, <span class="tei tei-q">“puts an end to the
        child's evil days, and the father gets the spear to put away all
        evil. The child then joins its father and mother; its evil days are
        averted, and the water and the other things are buried, for they
        account them evil.”</span><a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href=
        "#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
        Similarly the ancient Greeks used to bury, or throw into the sea, or
        deposit at cross-roads, the things that had been used in ceremonies
        of purification, no doubt because the things were supposed to be
        tainted by the evil which had been transferred to them in the
        rites.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href=
        "#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> Another
        example of the use of a winnowing-fan in what may be called a
        purificatory ceremony is furnished by the practice of the Chinese of
        Foo-Chow. A lad who is suffering from small-pox is made to squat in a
        large winnowing sieve. On his head is placed a piece of red cloth,
        and on the cloth are laid some parched beans, which are then allowed
        to roll off. As the name for beans, pronounced in the local dialect,
        is identical with the common name for small-pox, and as moreover the
        scars left by the pustules are thought to resemble beans, it appears
        to be imagined that just as the beans roll off the boy's head, so
        will the pustules vanish from his body without leaving a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> trace behind.<a id="noteref_38" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> Thus the
        cure depends on the principle of homoeopathic magic. Perhaps on the
        same principle a winnowing-fan is employed in the ceremony from a
        notion that it will help to waft or fan away the disease like chaff
        from the grain. We may compare a purificatory ceremony observed by
        the Karens of Burma at the naming of a new-born child. Amongst these
        people <span class="tei tei-q">“children are supposed to come into
        the world defiled, and unless that defilement is removed, they will
        be unfortunate, and unsuccessful in their undertakings. An Elder

        it down the child's arm, saying:</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in some of
        the foregoing instances the employment of the winnowing-fan may have
        been suggested by the proper use of the implement as a means of
        separating the corn from the chaff, the same operation being extended
        by analogy to rid men of evils of various sorts which would otherwise
        adhere to them like husks to the grain. It was in this way that the
        ancients explained the use of the winnowing-fan in the
        mysteries.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href=

        "page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> for setting a newborn child in a winnowing-fan
        and surrounding it with corn was probably the wish to communicate to
        the infant, on the principle of sympathetic magic, the fertility and
        especially the power of growth possessed by the grain. This was in
        substance the explanation which W. Mannhardt gave of the
        custom.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=
        "#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> He
        rightly insisted on the analogy which many peoples, and in particular
        the ancient Greeks, have traced between the sowing of seed and the
        begetting of children,<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href=
        "#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> and he
        confirmed his view of the function of the winnowing-fan in these
        ceremonies by aptly comparing a German custom of sowing barley or
        flax seed over weakly and stunted children in the belief that this
        will make them grow with the growth of the barley or the flax.<a id=

        Esthonian mode of accomplishing the same object is to set the child
        in the middle of a plot of ground where a sower is sowing hemp and to
        leave the little one there till the sowing is finished; after that
        they imagine that the child will shoot up in stature like the hemp

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the foregoing
        evidence before us of a widespread custom of placing newborn children
        in winnowing-fans we clearly cannot argue that Dionysus must
        necessarily have been a god of the corn because Greek tradition and
        Greek art represent him as an infant cradled in a winnowing-fan. The
        argument would prove too much, for it would apply equally to all the
        infants that have been so cradled in all parts of the world. We
        cannot even press the argument drawn from the surname <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He of the Winnowing-fan”</span> which was borne by
        Dionysus, since we have seen that similar names are borne for similar
        reasons in India by persons who have no claim whatever to be regarded
        as deities of the corn. Yet when all necessary deductions have been
        made on this score, the association of Dionysus with the
        winnowing-fan appears to be too intimate to be explained away as a
        mere reminiscence of a practice to which every Greek baby, whether
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012"
        id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> human or divine, had to
        submit. That practice would hardly account either for the use of the
        winnowing-fan in the mysteries or for the appearance of the
        implement, filled with fruitage of various kinds, on the monuments
        which set forth the ritual of Dionysus.<a id="noteref_45" name=

        last emblem points plainly to a conception of the god as a
        personification of the fruits of the earth in general; and as if to
        emphasise the idea of fecundity conveyed by such a symbol there
        sometimes appears among the fruits in the winnowing-fan an effigy of
        the male organ of generation. The prominent place which that effigy
        occupied in the worship of Dionysus<a id="noteref_46" name=
        "noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> hints
        broadly, if it does not strictly prove, that to the Greek mind the
        god stood for the powers of fertility in general, animal as well as
        vegetable. In the thought of the ancients no sharp line of
        distinction divided the fertility of animals from the fertility of
        plants; rather the two ideas met and blended in a nebulous haze. We
        need not wonder, therefore, that the same coarse but expressive
        emblem figured conspicuously in the ritual of Father Liber, the
        Italian counterpart of Dionysus, who in return for the homage paid to
        the symbol of his creative energy was believed to foster the growth
        of the crops and to guard the fields against the powers of
        evil.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like the other
        gods of vegetation whom we considered in the last volume, Dionysus
        was believed to have died a violent death, but to have been brought
        to life again; and his sufferings, death, and resurrection were
        enacted in his sacred rites. His tragic story is thus told by the
        poet Nonnus. Zeus in the form of a serpent visited Persephone, and
        she bore him Zagreus, that is, Dionysus, a horned infant. Scarcely
        was he born, when the babe mounted the throne of his father Zeus and
        mimicked the great god by brandishing the lightning in his tiny hand.
        But he did not occupy the throne long; for the treacherous Titans,
        their faces whitened with chalk, attacked him with knives while he
        was looking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg
        013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> at
        himself in a mirror. For a time he evaded their assaults by turning
        himself into various shapes, assuming the likeness successively of
        Zeus and Cronus, of a young man, of a lion, a horse, and a serpent.
        Finally, in the form of a bull, he was cut to pieces by the murderous
        knives of his enemies.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> His
        Cretan myth, as related by Firmicus Maternus, ran thus. He was said
        to have been the bastard son of Jupiter, a Cretan king. Going abroad,
        Jupiter transferred the throne and sceptre to the youthful Dionysus,
        but, knowing that his wife Juno cherished a jealous dislike of the
        child, he entrusted Dionysus to the care of guards upon whose
        fidelity he believed he could rely. Juno, however, bribed the guards,
        and amusing the child with rattles and a cunningly-wrought
        looking-glass lured him into an ambush, where her satellites, the
        Titans, rushed upon him, cut him limb from limb, boiled his body with
        various herbs, and ate it. But his sister Minerva, who had shared in
        the deed, kept his heart and gave it to Jupiter on his return,
        revealing to him the whole history of the crime. In his rage, Jupiter
        put the Titans to death by torture, and, to soothe his grief for the
        loss of his son, made an image in which he enclosed the child's
        heart, and then built a temple in his honour.<a id="noteref_49" name=
        "noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> In this
        version a Euhemeristic turn has been given to the myth by
        representing Jupiter and Juno (Zeus and Hera) as a king and queen of
        Crete. The guards referred to are the mythical Curetes who danced a
        war-dance round the infant Dionysus, as they are said to have done
        round the infant Zeus.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=

        noteworthy is the legend, recorded both by Nonnus and Firmicus, that
        in his infancy Dionysus occupied for a short time the throne of his
        father Zeus. So Proclus tells us that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dionysus was the last king of the gods appointed by
        Zeus. For his father set him on the kingly throne, and placed in his

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> Such
        traditions point to a custom of temporarily investing the king's son
        with the royal dignity as a preliminary to sacrificing him instead of
        his father. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg
        014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Pomegranates were supposed to have sprung from the blood of Dionysus,
        as anemones from the blood of Adonis and violets from the blood of
        Attis: hence women refrained from eating seeds of pomegranates at the
        festival of the Thesmophoria.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52"

        According to some, the severed limbs of Dionysus were pieced
        together, at the command of Zeus, by Apollo, who buried them on
        Parnassus.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=

        "#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> However,
        according to another account, the grave of Dionysus was at Thebes,
        where he is said to have been torn in pieces.<a id="noteref_55" name=

        the resurrection of the slain god is not mentioned, but in other
        versions of the myth it is variously related. According to one
        version, which represented Dionysus as a son of Zeus and Demeter, his
        mother pieced together his mangled limbs and made him young
        again.<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href=

        Dionysus was represented in every detail. All that he had done or
        suffered in his last moments was enacted before the eyes of his
        worshippers, who tore a live bull to pieces with their teeth and
        roamed the woods with frantic shouts. In front of them was carried a
        casket supposed to contain the sacred heart of Dionysus, and to the
        wild music of flutes and cymbals they mimicked the rattles by which
        the infant god had been lured to his doom.<a id="noteref_62" name=

        even appears that a general doctrine of resurrection, or at least of
        immortality, was inculcated on the worshippers; for Plutarch, writing
        to console his wife on the death of their infant daughter, comforts
        her with the thought of the immortality of the soul as taught by
        tradition and revealed in the mysteries of Dionysus.<a id=

        local Argive tradition was that he went down through the Alcyonian
        lake; and his return from the lower world, in other words his
        resurrection, was annually celebrated on the spot by the Argives, who
        summoned him from the water by trumpet blasts, while they threw a

            the Indians of British Columbia.</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
        tearing in pieces the bodies of animals and of men and then devouring
        them raw has been practised as a religious rite by savages in modern
        times. We need not therefore dismiss as a fable the testimony of
        antiquity to the observance of similar rites among the frenzied
        worshippers of Bacchus. An English missionary to the Coast Indians of
        British Columbia has thus described a scene like the cannibal orgies
        of the Bacchanals. After mentioning that an old chief had ordered a
        female slave to be dragged to the beach, murdered, and thrown into
        the water, he proceeds as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not
        see the murder, but, immediately after, I saw crowds of people
        running out of those houses near to where the corpse was thrown, and
        forming themselves into groups at a good distance away. This I learnt
        was from fear of what was to follow. Presently two bands of furious
        wretches appeared, each headed by a man in a state of nudity. They
        gave vent to the most unearthly sounds, and the two naked men made
        themselves look as unearthly as possible, proceeding in a creeping
        kind of stoop, and stepping like two proud horses, at the same time
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019"
        id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> shooting forward each arm
        alternately, which they held out at full length for a little time in
        the most defiant manner. Besides this, the continual jerking their
        heads back, causing their long black hair to twist about, added much
        to their savage appearance. For some time they pretended to be
        seeking the body, and the instant they came where it lay they
        commenced screaming and rushing round it like so many angry wolves.
        Finally they seized it, dragged it out of the water, and laid it on
        the beach, where I was told the naked men would commence tearing it
        to pieces with their teeth. The two bands of men immediately
        surrounded them, and so hid their horrid work. In a few minutes the
        crowd broke into two, when each of the naked cannibals appeared with
        half of the body in his hands. Separating a few yards, they
        commenced, amid horrid yells, their still more horrid feast. The
        sight was too terrible to behold. I left the gallery with a depressed
        heart. I may mention that the two bands of savages just alluded to
        belong to that class which the whites term <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘medicine-men.’</span> ”</span> The same writer informs
        us that at the winter ceremonials of these Indians <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the cannibal, on such occasions, is generally supplied
        with two, three, or four human bodies, which he tears to pieces
        before his audience. Several persons, either from bravado or as a
        charm, present their arms for him to bite. I have seen several whom
        he has bitten, and I hear two have died from the effects.”</span> And
        when corpses were not forthcoming, these cannibals apparently seized
        and devoured living people. Mr. Duncan has seen hundreds of the
        Tsimshian Indians sitting in their canoes which they had just pushed
        off from the shore in order to escape being torn to pieces by a party
        of prowling cannibals. Others of these Indians contented themselves
        with tearing dogs to pieces, while their attendants kept up a
        growling noise, or a whoop, <span class="tei tei-q">“which was
        seconded by a screeching noise made from an instrument which they
        believe to be the abode of a spirit.”</span><a id="noteref_90" name=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Duncan's
        account of these savage rites has been fully borne out by later
        observation. Among the Kwakiutl Indians the Cannibals (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hamatsas</span></span>) are the highest in rank
        of the Secret Societies. They devour corpses, bite pieces out of
        living people, and formerly ate slaves who had been killed for the
        purpose. But when their fury has subsided, they are obliged to pay
        compensation to the persons whom they have bitten and to the owners
        of slaves whom they have killed. The indemnity consists sometimes of
        blankets, sometimes of canoes. In the latter case the tariff is
        fixed: one bite, one canoe. For some time after eating human flesh
        the cannibal has to observe a great many rules, which regulate his
        eating and drinking, his going out and his coming in, his clothing
        and his intercourse with his wife.<a id="noteref_91" name=
        "noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> Similar
        customs prevail among other tribes of the same coast, such as the
        Bella Coola, the Tsimshian, the Niska, and the Nootka. In the Nootka
        tribe members of the Panther Society tear dogs to pieces and devour
        them. They wear masks armed with canine teeth.<a id="noteref_92"

        the Haida Indians of the Queen Charlotte Islands there is one
        religion of cannibalism and another of dog-eating. The cannibals in a
        state of frenzy, real or pretended, bite flesh out of the extended
        arms of their fellow villagers. When they issue forth with cries of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hop-pop</span></span> to observe this solemn
        rite, all who are of a different religious persuasion make haste to
        get out of their way; but men of the cannibal creed and of stout
        hearts will resolutely hold out their arms to be <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bitten. The sect of dog-eaters cut or
        tear dogs to pieces and devour some of the flesh; but they have to
        pay for the dogs which they consume in their religious
        enthusiasm.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> In the
        performance of these savage rites the frenzied actors are believed to
        be inspired by a Cannibal Spirit and a Dog-eating Spirit
        respectively.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href=
        "#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> Again,
        in Morocco there is an order of saints known as Isowa or Aïsawa,
        followers of Mohammed ben Isa or Aïsa of Mequinez, whose tomb is at
        Fez. Every year on their founder's birthday they assemble at his
        shrine or elsewhere and holding each other's hands dance a frantic
        dance round a fire. <span class="tei tei-q">“While the mad dance is
        still proceeding, a sudden rush is made from the sanctuary, and the
        dancers, like men delirious, speed away to a place where live goats
        are tethered in readiness. At sight of these animals the fury of the
        savage and excited crowd reaches its height. In a few minutes the
        wretched animals are cut, or rather torn to pieces, and an orgy takes
        place over the raw and quivering flesh. When they seem satiated, the
        Emkaddim, who is generally on horseback, and carries a long stick,
        forms a sort of procession, preceded by wild music, if such
        discordant sounds will bear the name. Words can do no justice to the
        frightful scene which now ensues. The naked savages—for on these
        occasions a scanty piece of cotton is all their clothing—with their
        long black hair, ordinarily worn in plaits, tossed about by the rapid
        to-and-fro movements of the head, with faces and hands reeking with
        blood, and uttering loud cries resembling the bleating of goats,
        again enter the town. The place is now at their mercy, and the people
        avoid them as much as possible by shutting themselves up in their
        houses. A Christian or a Jew would run great risk of losing his life
        if either were found in the street. Goats are pushed out from the
        doors, and these the fanatics tear immediately to pieces with their
        hands, and then dispute over the morsels of <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> bleeding flesh, as though they were ravenous
        wolves instead of men. Snakes also are thrown to them as tests of
        their divine frenzy, and these share the fate of the goats. Sometimes
        a luckless dog, straying as dogs will stray in a tumult, is seized
        on. Then the laymen, should any be at hand, will try to prevent the
        desecration of pious mouths. But the fanatics sometimes prevail, and
        the unclean animal, abhorred by the mussulman, is torn in pieces and
        devoured, or pretended to be devoured, with indiscriminating
        rage.”</span><a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
        killing a god in animal form, which we shall examine more in detail
        further on, belongs to a very early stage of human culture, and is
        apt in later times to be misunderstood. The advance of thought tends
        to strip the old animal and plant gods of their bestial and vegetable
        husk, and to leave their human attributes (which are always the
        kernel of the conception) as the final and sole residuum. In other
        words, animal and plant gods tend to become purely anthropomorphic.
        When they have become wholly or nearly so, the animals and plants
        which were at first the deities themselves, still retain a vague and
        ill-understood connexion with the anthropomorphic gods who have been
        developed out of them. The origin of the relationship between the
        deity and the animal or plant having been forgotten, various stories
        are invented to explain it. These explanations may follow one of two
        lines according as they are based on the habitual or on the
        exceptional treatment of the sacred animal or plant. The sacred
        animal was habitually spared, and only exceptionally slain; and
        accordingly the myth might be devised to explain either why it was
        spared or why it was killed. Devised for the former purpose, the myth
        would tell of some service rendered to the deity by the animal;
        devised for the latter purpose, the myth would tell of some injury
        inflicted by the animal on the god. The reason given for sacrificing
        goats to Dionysus exemplifies a myth of the latter sort. They were
        sacrificed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg
        023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        him, it was said, because they injured the vine.<a id="noteref_96"
        name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> Now the
        goat, as we have seen, was originally an embodiment of the god
        himself. But when the god had divested himself of his animal
        character and had become essentially anthropomorphic, the killing of
        the goat in his worship came to be regarded no longer as a slaying of
        the deity himself, but as a sacrifice offered to him; and since some
        reason had to be assigned why the goat in particular should be
        sacrificed, it was alleged that this was a punishment inflicted on
        the goat for injuring the vine, the object of the god's especial
        care. Thus we have the strange spectacle of a god sacrificed to
        himself on the ground that he is his own enemy. And as the deity is
        supposed to partake of the victim offered to him, it follows that,
        when the victim is the god's old self, the god eats of his own flesh.
        Hence the goat-god Dionysus is represented as eating raw goat's
        blood;<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href=
        "#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        analogy of these instances we may conjecture that wherever a deity is

        was originally nothing but the deity himself.<a id="noteref_99" name=

        distorted reminiscences of a custom of sacrificing divine kings in

        broken bodies over the fields for the purpose of fertilising them. In
        regard to Lycurgus, king of the Thracian tribe of the Edonians, it is
        expressly said that his subjects at the bidding of an oracle caused
        him to be rent in pieces by horses for the purpose of restoring the
        fertility of the ground after a period of barrenness and

        not in this tradition a reminiscence of a custom of sacrificing the

        Thessaly or Boeotia, is said to have been doomed by an oracle to be
        sacrificed at the altar in order to remove the curse of barrenness
        which afflicted his country; however, he contrived to evade the
        sentence and in a fit of madness killed his own son Learchus,
        mistaking him for a wild beast. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        close resemblance between the legends of King Athamas and King
        Lycurgus furnishes a ground for believing both legends to be based on
        a real custom of sacrificing either the king himself or one of his
        sons for the good of the country; and the story that the king's son
        Dryas perished because his frenzied father mistook him for a
        vine-branch fits in well with the theory that the victim in these

        rites, is annually performed at the Carnival in all the Christian
        villages which cluster round Viza, the ancient Bizya, a town of
        Thrace situated about midway between Adrianople and Constantinople.
        In antiquity the city was the capital of the Thracian tribe of the
        Asti; the kings had their palace there,<a id="noteref_113" name=
        "noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class=

        of some of these old kings.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114"
        href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> The
        date of the celebration is Cheese Monday, as it is locally called,
        which is the Monday of the last week of Carnival. At Viza itself the
        mummery has been shorn of some of its ancient features, but these
        have been kept up at the villages and have been particularly observed
        and recorded at the village of St. George (Haghios Gheorgios). It is
        to the drama as acted at that village that the following description
        specially applies. The principal parts in the drama are taken by two
        men disguised in goatskins. Each of them wears a headdress made of a
        complete goatskin, which is stuffed so as to rise a foot or more like
        a shako over his head, while the skin falls over the face, forming a
        mask with holes cut for the eyes and mouth. Their shoulders are
        thickly padded with hay to protect them from the blows which used to
        be rained very liberally on their backs. Fawnskins on their shoulders
        and goatskins on their legs are or used to be part of their
        equipment, and another indispensable part of it is a number of
        sheep-bells tied round their waists. One of the two skin-clad actors
        carries a bow and the other a wooden effigy of the male organ of
        generation. Both these actors must be married men. According to Mr.
        Vizyenos, they are chosen for periods of four years. Two unmarried
        boys dressed as girls and sometimes called brides also take part in
        the play; and a man disguised as an old woman in rags carries a mock
        baby in a basket; the brat is supposed to be a seven-months' child
        born out of wedlock and begotten by an unknown <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> father. The basket in which the hopeful
        infant is paraded bears the ancient name of the winnowing-fan
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">likni</span></span>, contracted from
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        receives the very title <span class="tei tei-q">“He of the
        Winnowing-fan”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Liknites</span></span>) which in antiquity was
        applied to Dionysus. Two other actors, clad in rags with blackened
        faces and armed with stout saplings, play the parts of a gypsy-man
        and his wife; others personate policemen armed with swords and whips;
        and the troupe is completed by a man who discourses music on a
        bagpipe.</p>

        little drama is spent by them going from door to door collecting
        bread, eggs, or money. At every door the two skin-clad maskers knock,
        the boys disguised as girls dance, and the gypsy man and wife enact
        an obscene pantomime on the straw-heap before the house. When every
        house in the village has been thus visited, the troop takes up
        position on the open space before the village church, where the whole
        population has already mustered to witness the performance. After a
        dance hand in hand, in which all the actors take part, the two
        skin-clad maskers withdraw and leave the field to the gypsies, who
        now pretend to forge a ploughshare, the man making believe to hammer
        the share and his wife to work the bellows. At this point the old
        woman's baby is supposed to grow up at a great pace, to develop a
        huge appetite for meat and drink, and to clamour for a wife. One of
        the skin-clad men now pursues one of the two pretended brides, and a
        mock marriage is celebrated between the couple. After these nuptials
        have been performed with a parody of a real wedding, the mock
        bridegroom is shot by his comrade with the bow and falls down on his
        face like dead. His slayer thereupon feigns to skin him with a knife;
        but the dead man's wife laments over her deceased husband with loud
        cries, throwing herself across his prostrate body. In this
        lamentation the slayer himself and all the other actors join in: a
        Christian funeral service is burlesqued; and the pretended corpse is
        lifted up as if to be carried to the grave. At this point, however,
        the dead man disconcerts the preparations for his burial by suddenly
        coming to life <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg

        with a repetition of the pretence of forging a ploughshare, but this
        time the gypsy man hammers on a real share. When the implement is
        supposed to have been fashioned, a real plough is brought forward,
        the mockery appears to cease, the two boys dressed as girls are yoked
        to the plough and drag it twice round the village square contrary to
        the way of the sun. One of the two skin-clad men walks at the tail of
        the plough, the other guides it in front, and a third man follows in
        the rear scattering seed from a basket. After the two rounds have
        been completed, the gypsy and his wife are yoked to the plough, and
        drag it a third time round the square, the two skin-clad men still
        playing the part of ploughmen. At Viza the plough is drawn by the
        skin-clad men themselves. While the plough is going its rounds,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
        ceremonies, still annually held at and near an old capital of
        Thracian kings, the points of similarity to the ritual of the ancient
        Thracian deity Dionysus are sufficiently obvious.<a id="noteref_117"

        goatskins in which the principal actors are disguised remind us of
        the identification of Dionysus with a goat: the infant, cradled in a
        winnowing-fan and taking its name from the implement, answers exactly
        to the traditions and the monuments which represent the infant
        Dionysus as similarly cradled and similarly named: the pretence that
        the baby is a seven-months' child born out of wedlock and begotten by
        an unknown father tallies precisely with the legend that Dionysus was
        born prematurely in the seventh month as the offspring of an intrigue
        between a mortal woman and a mysterious divine father:<a id=
        "noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> the
        same coarse symbol of reproductive energy which characterised the
        ancient ritual of Dionysus figures conspicuously in the modern drama:
        the annual mock marriage of the goatskin-clad mummer with the
        pretended bride may be compared with the annual pretence of marrying
        Dionysus to the Queen of Athens: and the simulated slaughter and
        resurrection of the same goatskin-clad actor may be compared with the
        traditional slaughter and resurrection of the god himself. Further,
        the ceremony of ploughing, in which after his resurrection the
        goatskin-clad mummer takes a prominent part, fits in well not only
        with the legend that Dionysus was the first to yoke oxen to the
        plough, but also with the symbolism of the winnowing-fan in his
        worship; while the prayers for plentiful crops which accompany the
        ploughing accord with the omens of an abundant harvest which were
        drawn of old from the mystic light seen to illumine by night one of
        his ancient sanctuaries in Thrace. Lastly, in the ceremony as
        observed at Kosti the giving of wine by the king's <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> attendant is an act worthy of the
        wine-god: the throwing of seed by the king can only be interpreted,
        like the ploughing, as a charm to promote the fertility of the
        ground; and the royal title borne by the principal masker harmonises
        well with the theory that the part of the god of the corn and the
        wine was of old sustained by the Thracian kings who reigned at
        Bisya.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we ask, To what
        ancient festival of Dionysus does the modern celebration of the
        Carnival in Thrace most nearly correspond? the answer can be hardly
        doubtful. The Thracian drama of the mock marriage of the
        goatskin-clad mummer, his mimic death and resurrection, and his
        subsequent ploughing, corresponds both in date and in character most
        nearly to the Athenian festival of the Anthesteria, which was
        celebrated at Athens during three days in early spring, towards the
        end of February or the beginning of March. Thus the date of the
        Anthesteria could not fall far from, and it might sometimes actually
        coincide with, the last week of the Carnival, the date of the
        Thracian celebration. While the details of the festival of the
        Anthesteria are obscure, its general character is well known. It was
        a festival both of wine-drinking and of the dead, whose souls were
        supposed to revisit the city and to go about the streets, just as in
        modern Europe and in many other parts of the world the ghosts of the
        departed are still believed to return to their old homes on one day
        of the year and to be entertained by their relatives at a solemn
        Feast of All Souls.<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href=
        "#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a> But the
        Dionysiac nature of the festival was revealed not merely by the
        opening of the wine-vats and the wassailing which went on throughout
        the city among freemen and slaves alike; on the second day of the
        festival the marriage of Dionysus with the Queen of Athens was
        celebrated with great solemnity at the Bucolium or Ox-stall.<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> that at
        this sacred marriage in the Ox-stall the god was represented wholly
        or partly in bovine shape, whether by an image or by an actor dressed
        in the hide and wearing the horns of a bull; for, as we have seen,
        Dionysus was often supposed to assume the form of a bull and to
        present himself in that guise to his worshippers. If this conjecture
        should prove to be correct—though a demonstration of it can hardly be
        expected—the sacred marriage of the Queen to the Bull-god at Athens
        would be parallel to the sacred marriage of the Queen to the Bull-god
        at Cnossus, according to the interpretation which I have suggested of
        the myth of Pasiphae and the Minotaur;<a id="noteref_122" name=
        "noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> only
        whereas the bull-god at Cnossus, if I am right, stood for the Sun,
        the bull-god at Athens stood for the powers of vegetation, especially
        the corn and the vines. It would not be surprising that among a
        cattle-breeding people in early days the bull, regarded as a type of
        strength and reproductive energy, should be employed to symbolise and
        represent more than one of the great powers of nature. If Dionysus
        did indeed figure as a bull at his marriage, it is not improbable
        that on that occasion his representative, whether a real bull or a
        man dressed in a bull's hide, took part in a ceremony of ploughing;
        for we have seen that the invention of yoking oxen to the plough was
        ascribed to Dionysus, and we know that the Athenians performed a
        sacred ceremony of ploughing, which went by the name of the Ox-yoked
        Ploughing and took place in a field or other open piece of ground at
        the foot of the Acropolis.<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123"
        href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        reasonable conjecture that the field of the Ox-yoked Ploughing may
        have adjoined the building called the Ox-stall in which the marriage
        of Dionysus with the Queen was solemnised;<a id="noteref_124" name=

        the ancient festival of the Anthesteria, so far as its features are
        preserved by tradition or can be restored by the use of reasonable
        conjecture, presents several important analogies to the modern
        Thracian Carnival in respect of wine-drinking, a mock marriage of
        disguised actors, and a ceremony of ploughing. The resemblance
        between the ancient and the modern ritual would be still closer if
        some eminent modern scholars, who wrote before the discovery of the
        Thracian Carnival, and whose judgment was therefore not biassed by
        its analogy to the Athenian festival, are right in holding that
        another important feature of the Anthesteria was the dramatic death
        and resurrection of Dionysus.<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126"

        they conjecture that at Athens the body of Dionysus was dramatically
        broken into fourteen fragments, one for each of the fourteen altars,
        and that it was afterwards dramatically pieced together and restored
        to life by the fourteen Sacred Women, just as the broken body of
        Osiris was pieced together by a company of gods and goddesses and
        restored to life by his sister Isis.<a id="noteref_130" name=

        conjecture is ingenious and plausible, but with our existing sources
        of information it must remain a conjecture and <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nothing more. Could it be established, it
        would forge another strong link in the chain of evidence which binds
        the modern Thracian Carnival to the ancient Athenian Anthesteria; for
        in that case the drama of the divine death and resurrection would
        have to be added to the other features which these two festivals of
        spring possess in common, and we should have to confess that Greece
        had what we may call its Good Friday and its Easter Sunday long
        before the events took place in Judaea which diffused these two
        annual commemorations of the Dying and Reviving God over a great part
        of the civilised world. From so simple a beginning may flow
        consequences so far-reaching and impressive; for in the light of the
        rude Thracian ceremony we may surmise that the high tragedy of the
        death and resurrection of Dionysus originated in a rustic mummers'
        play acted by ploughmen for the purpose of fertilising the brown
        earth which they turned up with the gleaming share in sunshiny days
        of spring, as they followed the slow-paced oxen down the long furrows
        in the fallow field. Later on we shall see that a play of the same
        sort is still acted, or was acted down to recent years, by English
        yokels on Plough Monday.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before we pass
        from the tragic myth and ritual of Dionysus to the sweeter story and
        milder worship of Demeter and Persephone, the true Greek deities of
        the corn, it is fair to admit that the legends of human sacrifice,
        which have left so dark a stain on the memory of the old Thracian
        god, may have been nothing more than mere misinterpretations of a
        sacrificial ritual in which an animal victim was treated as a human
        being. For example, at Tenedos the new-born calf sacrificed to
        Dionysus was shod in buskins, and the mother cow was tended like a
        woman in child-bed.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=

        the other hand it is equally possible, and perhaps more probable,
        that these curious rites were themselves mitigations of an older and
        ruder custom of sacrificing human beings, and that the later pretence
        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name=
        "Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> treating the
        sacrificial victims as if they were human beings was merely part of a
        pious and merciful fraud, which palmed off on the deity less precious
        victims than living men and women. This interpretation is supported
        by the undoubted cases in which animals have been substituted for

        and cruelty imprinted on the features of this barbarous deity.</p>

        Attis, and the Egyptian one of Isis and Osiris. In the Greek fable,
        as in its Asiatic and Egyptian counterparts, a goddess mourns the
        loss of a loved one, who personifies the vegetation, more especially
        the corn, which dies in winter to revive in spring; only whereas the
        Oriental imagination figured the loved and lost one as a dead lover
        or a dead husband lamented by his leman or his wife, Greek fancy

        the writer entertained of the character and functions of the two
        goddesses: their natural shapes stand out sharply enough under the
        thin veil of poetical imagery. The youthful Persephone, so runs the
        tale, was gathering roses and lilies, crocuses and violets, hyacinths
        and narcissuses in a lush meadow, when the earth gaped and Pluto,
        lord of the Dead, issuing from the abyss carried her off on his
        golden car to be his bride and queen in the gloomy subterranean
        world. Her sorrowing mother Demeter, with her yellow tresses veiled
        in a dark mourning mantle, sought her over land and sea, and learning
        from the Sun her daughter's fate she withdrew in high dudgeon from
        the gods and took up her abode at Eleusis, where she presented
        herself to the king's daughters in the guise of an old woman, sitting
        sadly under the shadow of an olive tree beside the Maiden's Well, to
        which the damsels had come to draw water in bronze pitchers for their
        father's house. In her wrath at her bereavement the goddess suffered
        not the seed to grow in the earth but kept it hidden under ground,
        and she vowed that never would she set foot on Olympus and never
        would she let the corn sprout till her lost daughter should be
        restored to her. Vainly the oxen dragged the ploughs to and fro in
        the fields; vainly the sower dropped the barley seed in the brown
        furrows; nothing came up from the parched and crumbling soil. Even
        the Rarian plain near Eleusis, which was wont to wave with yellow
        harvests, lay bare and fallow.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135"

        would have perished of hunger and the gods would have been robbed of
        the sacrifices which were their due, if Zeus in alarm had not
        commanded Pluto to disgorge his prey, to restore his bride Persephone
        to her mother Demeter. The grim lord of the Dead smiled and obeyed,
        but before he sent back his queen to the upper air on a golden car,
        he gave her the seed of a pomegranate to eat, which ensured that she
        would return to him. But Zeus stipulated that henceforth Persephone
        should spend two thirds of every <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class=

        world and one third of the year with her husband in the nether world,
        from which she was to return year by year when the earth was gay with
        spring flowers. Gladly the daughter then returned to the sunshine,
        gladly her mother received her and fell upon her neck; and in her joy
        at recovering the lost one Demeter made the corn to sprout from the
        clods of the ploughed fields and all the broad earth to be heavy with
        leaves and blossoms. And straightway she went and shewed this happy
        sight to the princes of Eleusis, to Triptolemus, Eumolpus, Diocles,
        and to the king Celeus himself, and moreover she revealed to them her
        sacred rites and mysteries. Blessed, says the poet, is the mortal man
        who has seen these things, but he who has had no share of them in
        life will never be happy in death when he has descended into the
        darkness of the grave. So the two goddesses departed to dwell in
        bliss with the gods on Olympus; and the bard ends the hymn with a
        pious prayer to Demeter and Persephone that they would be pleased to
        grant him a livelihood in return for his song.<a id="noteref_136"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        generally recognised, and indeed it seems scarcely open to doubt,
        that the main theme which the poet set before himself in composing
        this hymn was to describe the traditional foundation of the
        Eleusinian mysteries by the goddess Demeter. The whole poem leads up
        to the transformation scene in which the bare leafless expanse of the
        Eleusinian plain is suddenly turned, at the will of the goddess, into
        a vast sheet of ruddy corn; the beneficent deity takes the princes of
        Eleusis, shews them what she has done, teaches them her mystic rites,
        and vanishes with her daughter to heaven. The revelation of the
        mysteries is the triumphal close of the piece. This conclusion is
        confirmed by a more minute examination of the poem, which proves that
        the poet has given, not merely a general account of the foundation of
        the mysteries, but also in more or less veiled language mythical
        explanations of the origin of particular rites which we have good
        reason to believe formed essential <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> features of the festival. Amongst the rites as
        to which the poet thus drops significant hints are the preliminary
        fast of the candidates for initiation, the torchlight procession, the
        all-night vigil, the sitting of the candidates, veiled and in
        silence, on stools covered with sheepskins, the use of scurrilous
        language, the breaking of ribald jests, and the solemn communion with
        the divinity by participation in a draught of barley-water from a
        holy chalice.<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is yet
        another and a deeper secret of the mysteries which the author of the
        poem appears to have divulged under cover of his narrative. He tells
        us how, as soon as she had transformed the barren brown expanse of
        the Eleusinian plain into a field of golden grain, she gladdened the
        eyes of Triptolemus and the other Eleusinian princes by shewing them
        the growing or standing corn. When we compare this part of the story
        with the statement of a Christian writer of the second century,
        Hippolytus, that the very heart of the mysteries consisted in shewing
        to the initiated a reaped ear of corn,<a id="noteref_138" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        hardly doubt that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg
        039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        poet of the hymn was well acquainted with this solemn rite, and that
        he deliberately intended to explain its origin in precisely the same
        way as he explained other rites of the mysteries, namely by
        representing Demeter as having set the example of performing the
        ceremony in her own person. Thus myth and ritual mutually explain and
        confirm each other. The poet of the seventh century before our era
        gives us the myth—he could not without sacrilege have revealed the
        ritual: the Christian father reveals the ritual, and his revelation
        accords perfectly with the veiled hint of the old poet. On the whole,
        then, we may, with many modern scholars, confidently accept the
        statement of the learned Christian father Clement of Alexandria, that
        the myth of Demeter and Persephone was acted as a sacred drama in the
        mysteries of Eleusis.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=

        original kernel of the myth which appears to later ages surrounded
        and transfigured by an aureole of awe and mystery, lit up by some of
        the most brilliant rays of Grecian literature and art? If we follow
        the indications given by our oldest literary authority on the
        subject, the author of the Homeric hymn to Demeter, the riddle is not
        hard to read; the figures of the two goddesses, the mother and the
        daughter, resolve themselves into personifications of the corn.<a id=

        whose absence the barley seed is hidden in the earth and the fields
        lie bare and fallow; on whose return in spring to the upper world the
        corn shoots up from the clods and the earth is heavy with leaves and
        blossoms—this goddess can surely be nothing else than a mythical
        embodiment of the vegetation, and particularly of the corn, which is
        buried under the soil for some months of every winter and comes to
        life again, as from the grave, in the sprouting cornstalks and the
        opening flowers and foliage of every spring. No other reasonable and
        probable explanation of Persephone seems possible.<a id="noteref_142"
        name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> And if
        the daughter goddess was a personification of the young corn of the
        present year, may not the mother goddess be a personification of the
        old corn of last year, which has given birth to the new crops? The
        only alternative to this view of Demeter would seem to be to suppose
        that she is a personification of the earth, from whose broad bosom
        the corn and all other plants spring up, and of which accordingly
        they may appropriately enough be regarded as the daughters. This view
        of the original nature of Demeter has indeed been taken by some
        writers, both ancient and modern,<a id="noteref_143" name=
        "noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> one which can be
        reasonably maintained. But it appears to have been rejected by the
        author of the Homeric hymn to Demeter, for he not only distinguishes
        Demeter from the personified Earth but places the two in the sharpest
        opposition to each other. He tells us that it was Earth who, in
        accordance with the will of Zeus and to please Pluto, lured
        Persephone to her doom by causing the narcissuses to grow which
        tempted the young goddess to stray far beyond the reach of help in
        the lush meadow.<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href=
        "#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> Thus
        Demeter of the hymn, far from being identical with the Earth-goddess,
        must have regarded that divinity as her worst enemy, since it was to
        her insidious wiles that she owed the loss of her daughter. But if
        the Demeter of the hymn cannot have been a personification of the
        earth, the only alternative apparently is to conclude that she was a
        personification of the corn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this
        conclusion all the indications of the hymn-writer seem to harmonise.
        He certainly represents Demeter as the goddess by whose power and at
        whose pleasure the corn either grows or remains hidden in the ground;
        and to what deity can such powers be so fittingly ascribed as to the
        goddess of the corn? He calls Demeter yellow and tells how her yellow
        tresses flowed down on her shoulders;<a id="noteref_145" name=

        any colour be more appropriate with which to paint the divinity of
        the yellow grain? The same identification of Demeter with the ripe,
        the yellow corn is made even more clearly by a still older poet,
        Homer himself, or at all events the author of the fifth book of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Iliad</span></span>. There we read: <span class=

        corn from the chaff on the hurrying blast, so that the heaps of chaff

        the yellow Demeter who sifts the grain from the chaff at the
        threshing-floor can hardly be any other than the goddess of the
        yellow corn; she cannot be the Earth-goddess, for what has the
        Earth-goddess to do with the grain and the chaff blown about a
        threshing-floor? With this interpretation it agrees that elsewhere
        Homer speaks of men eating <span class="tei tei-q">“Demeter's
        corn”</span>;<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href=
        "#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> and
        still more definitely Hesiod speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        annual store of food, which the earth bears, Demeter's
        corn,”</span><a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href=
        "#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> thus
        distinguishing the goddess of the corn from the earth which bears it.
        Still more clearly does a later Greek poet personify the corn as
        Demeter when, in allusion to the time of the corn-reaping, he says
        that then <span class="tei tei-q">“the sturdy swains cleave Demeter

        just as the ripe or yellow corn was personified as the Yellow
        Demeter, so the unripe or green corn was personified as the Green
        Demeter. In that character the goddess had sanctuaries at Athens and
        other places; sacrifices were appropriately offered to Green Demeter
        in spring when the earth was growing green with the fresh vegetation,
        and the victims included sows big with young,<a id="noteref_150"

        roamed the mountains and woods in search of the wild fruits which the
        earth produced spontaneously from her womb for their subsistence. The

        flocks high overhead, the Greek husbandman knew that the rains were
        near and that the time of ploughing was at hand; but before he put
        his hand to the plough he prayed to Underground Zeus and to Holy
        Demeter for a heavy crop of Demeter's sacred corn. Then he guided the
        ox-drawn plough down the field, turning up the brown earth with the
        share, while a swain followed close behind with a hoe, who covered up
        the seed as fast as it fell to protect it from the voracious birds

        while the ordinary Greek farmer took the signal for ploughing from
        the clangour of the cranes, Hesiod and other writers who aimed at
        greater exactness laid it down as a rule that the ploughing should
        begin with the autumnal setting of the Pleiades in the morning, which
        in Hesiod's time fell on the twenty-sixth of October.<a id=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> our November. The Athenians called it
        Pyanepsion; the Boeotians named it significantly Damatrius, that is,
        Demeter's month, and they celebrated a feast of mourning because,
        says Plutarch, who as a Boeotian speaks with authority on such a
        matter, Demeter was then in mourning for the descent of
        Persephone.<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href=

        possible to express more clearly the true original nature of
        Persephone as the corn-seed which has just been buried in the earth?
        The obvious, the almost inevitable conclusion did not escape
        Plutarch. He tells us that the mournful rites which were held at the
        time of the autumn sowing nominally commemorated the actions of
        deities, but that the real sadness was for the fruits of the earth,
        some of which at that season dropped of themselves and vanished from
        the trees, while others in the shape of seed were committed with
        anxious thoughts to the ground by men, who scraped the earth and then
        huddled it up over the seed, just as if they were burying and
        mourning for the dead.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href=

        poet tells us how he went with two friends from the city to attend a
        festival given by farmers, who were offering first-fruits to Demeter
        from the store of barley with which she had filled their barns. The
        day was warm, indeed so hot that the very lizards, which love to bask
        and run about in the sun, were slumbering in the crevices of the
        stone-walls, and not a lark soared carolling into the blue vault of
        heaven. Yet despite the great heat there were everywhere signs of
        autumn. <span class="tei tei-q">“All things,”</span> says the poet,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“smelt of summer, but smelt of autumn
        too.”</span> Indeed the day was really autumnal; for a goat-herd who
        met the friends on their way to the rural merry-making, asked them
        whether they were bound for the treading of the grapes in the
        wine-presses. And when they had reached their destination and
        reclined at ease in the dappled shade of over-arching poplars and
        elms, with the babble of a neighbouring fountain, the buzz of the
        cicadas, the hum of bees, and the cooing of doves in their ears, the
        ripe apples and pears rolled in the grass at their feet and the
        branches of the wild-plum trees were bowed down to the earth with the
        weight of their purple fruit. So couched on soft beds of fragrant
        lentisk they passed the sultry hours singing ditties alternately,
        while a rustic image of Demeter, to whom the honours of the day were
        paid, stood smiling beside a heap of yellow grain on the
        threshing-floor, with corn-stalks and poppies in her hands.</p>

        precedes the vintage, the grain being reaped and garnered at the end
        of September. Travelling in rural districts of Argolis and Arcadia at
        that time of the year you pass from time to time piles of the
        orange-coloured cobs laid up ready to be shelled, or again heaps of
        the yellow grain beside the pods. But maize was unknown to the
        ancient Greeks, who, like their modern descendants, reaped their
        wheat and barley crops much earlier in the summer, usually from the
        end of April till June.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href=

        However, we may conclude that the day immortalised by Theocritus was
        one of those autumn days of great heat and effulgent beauty which in
        Greece may occur at any time up to the very verge of winter. I
        remember such a day at Panopeus on the borders of Phocis and Boeotia.
        It was the first of November, yet the sun shone in cloudless
        splendour and the heat was so great, that when I had examined the
        magnificent remains of ancient Greek fortification-walls which crown
        the summit of the hill, it was delicious to repose on a grassy slope
        in the shade of some fine holly-oaks and to inhale the sweet scent of
        the wild thyme, which perfumed all the air. But it was summer's
        farewell. Next morning the weather had completely changed. A grey
        November sky lowered sadly overhead, and grey mists hung like
        winding-sheets on the lower slopes of the barren mountains which shut
        in the fatal plain of Chaeronea.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 80%">The Greeks seem to have deferred the
            offering of first-fruits till the autumn in order to propitiate

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we may infer
        that in the rural districts of ancient Greece farmers offered their
        first-fruits of the barley harvest to Demeter in autumn about the
        time when the grapes were being trodden in the wine-presses and the
        ripe apples and pears littered the ground in the orchards. At first
        sight the lateness of the festival in the year is surprising; for in
        the lowlands of Greece at the present day barley is reaped at the end
        of April and wheat in May,<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168"
        href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        antiquity the time of harvest would seem not to have been very
        different, for Hesiod bids the husbandman put the sickle to the corn
        at the morning rising of the Pleiades,<a id="noteref_169" name=
        "noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class=

        the harvest was reaped in spring or early summer, why defer the
        offerings of corn to the Corn Goddess until the middle of autumn? The
        reason for the delay is not, so far as I am aware, explained by any
        ancient author, and accordingly it must remain for us a matter of
        conjecture. I surmise that the reason may have been a calculation on
        the part of the practical farmer that the best time to propitiate the
        Corn Goddess was not after harvest, when he had got all that was to
        be got out of her, but immediately before ploughing and sowing, when
        he had everything to hope from her good-will and everything to fear
        from her displeasure. When he had reaped his corn, and the sheaves
        had been safely garnered in his barns, he might, so to say, snap his
        fingers at the Corn Goddess. What could she do for him on the bare
        stubble-field which lay scorched and baking under the fierce rays of
        the sun all the long rainless summer through? But matters wore a very
        different aspect when, with the shortening and cooling of the days,
        he began to scan the sky for clouds<a id="noteref_171" name=
        "noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> and to
        listen for the cries of the cranes as they flew southward, heralding
        by their trumpet-like notes the approach of the autumnal rains. Then
        he knew that the time had come to break up the ground that it might
        receive the seed and be fertilised by the refreshing water of heaven;
        then he bethought him of the Corn Goddess once more and brought forth
        from the grange a share of the harvested corn with which to woo her
        favour and induce her to quicken the grain which he was about to
        commit to the earth. On this theory the Greek offering of
        first-fruits was prompted not so much by gratitude for past favours
        as by a shrewd eye to favours to come, and perhaps this
        interpretation of the custom does no serious injustice to the cool
        phlegmatic temper of the bucolic mind, which is more apt to be moved
        by considerations of profit than by sentiment. At all events the
        reasons suggested for delaying the harvest-festival accord perfectly
        with the natural conditions and seasons of farming in Greece. For in
        that country the summer is practically rainless, and during the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050"
        id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> long months of heat and
        drought the cultivation of the two ancient cereals, barley and wheat,
        is at a standstill. The first rains of autumn fall about the middle
        of October,<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href=
        "#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> and
        that was the Greek farmer's great time for ploughing and
        sowing.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href=
        "#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> Hence
        we should expect him to make his offering of first-fruits to the Corn
        Goddess shortly before he ploughed and sowed, and this expectation is
        entirely confirmed by the date which we have inferred for the
        offering from the evidence of Theocritus. Thus the sacrifice of
        barley to Demeter in the autumn would seem to have been not so much a
        thank-offering as a bribe judiciously administered to her at the very
        moment of all the year when her services were most urgently
        wanted.</p>

        progress of civilisation a number of petty agricultural communities
        have merged into a single state dependent for its subsistence mainly
        on the cultivation of the ground, it commonly happens that, though
        every farmer continues to perform for himself the simple old rites
        designed to ensure the blessing of the gods on his crops, the
        government undertakes to celebrate similar, though more stately and
        elaborate, rites on behalf of the whole people, lest the neglect of
        public worship should draw down on the country the wrath of the
        offended deities. Hence it comes about that, for all their pomp and
        splendour, the national festivals of such states are often merely
        magnified and embellished copies of homely rites and uncouth
        observances carried out by rustics in the open fields, in barns, and
        on threshing-floors. In ancient Egypt the religion of Isis and Osiris

        ancient Greece a like development may be traced in the religion of
        Demeter. If the Greek ploughman prayed to Demeter and Underground
        Zeus for a good crop before he put his hand to the plough in autumn,
        the authorities of the Athenian state celebrated about the same time
        and for the same purpose a public festival in honour of Demeter at
        Eleusis. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg
        051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It
        was called the Proerosia, which signifies <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Before the Ploughing”</span>; and as the festival was
        dedicated to her, Demeter herself bore the name of Proerosia.
        Tradition ran that once on a time the whole world was desolated by a
        famine, and that to remedy the evil the Pythian oracle bade the
        Athenians offer the sacrifice of the Proerosia on behalf of all men.
        They did so, and the famine ceased accordingly. Hence to testify
        their gratitude for the deliverance people sent the first-fruits of
        their harvest from all quarters to Athens.<a id="noteref_175" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the exact date
        at which the Proerosia or Festival before Ploughing took place is
        somewhat uncertain, and enquirers are divided in opinion as to
        whether it fell before or after the Great Mysteries, which began on
        the fifteenth or sixteenth of Boedromion, a month corresponding
        roughly to our September. Another name for the festival was
        Proarcturia, that is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Before

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> which
        points to a date either before the middle of September, when Arcturus
        is a morning star, or before the end of October, when Arcturus is an
        evening star.<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href=
        "#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> In
        favour of the earlier date it may be said, first, that the morning
        phase of Arcturus was well known and much observed, because it marked
        the middle of autumn, whereas little use was made of the evening
        phase of Arcturus for the purpose of dating;<a id="noteref_178" name=
        "noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> and,
        second, that in an official Athenian inscription the Festival before
        Ploughing (<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "el"><span style="font-style: italic">Proerosia</span></span>) is
        mentioned immediately before the Great <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> On the
        other hand, in favour of the later date, it may be said that as the
        autumnal rains in Greece set in about the middle of October, the
        latter part of that month would be a more suitable time for a
        ceremony at the opening of ploughing than the middle of September,
        when the soil is still parched with the summer drought; and, second,
        that this date is confirmed by a Greek inscription of the fourth or
        third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, found at Eleusis, in
        which the Festival before Ploughing is apparently mentioned in the
        month of Pyanepsion immediately before the festival of the Pyanepsia,
        which was held on the seventh day of that month.<a id="noteref_180"
        name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a> It is
        difficult to decide between these conflicting arguments, but on the
        whole I incline, not without hesitation, to agree with some eminent
        modern authorities in placing the Festival before Ploughing in
        Pyanepsion (October) after the Mysteries, rather than in Boedromion
        (September) before the Mysteries.<a id="noteref_181" name=
        "noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>
        However, we must bear in mind that as the Attic months, like the
        Greek months generally, were lunar,<a id="noteref_182" name=
        "noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a> their
        position in the solar year necessarily varied from year to year, and
        though these variations were periodically corrected by intercalation,
        nevertheless the beginning of each Attic month sometimes diverged by
        several weeks from the beginning of the corresponding month to which
        we equate it.<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href=
        "#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a> From
        this it follows that the Great Mysteries, which were always dated by
        the calendar month, must have annually shifted their place somewhat
        in the solar year; whereas the Festival before Ploughing, if it was
        indeed dated either by the morning or by the evening phase of
        Arcturus, must have occupied a fixed place in the solar year. Hence
        it appears to be not impossible that the Great Mysteries, oscillating
        to and fro with the inconstant moon, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> may sometimes have fallen before and sometimes
        after the Festival before Ploughing, which apparently always remained
        true to the constant star. At least this possibility, which seems to
        have been overlooked by previous enquirers, deserves to be taken into
        account. It is a corollary from the shifting dates of the lunar
        months that the official Greek calendar, in spite of its appearance
        of exactness, really furnished the ancient farmer with little
        trustworthy guidance as to the proper seasons for conducting the
        various operations of agriculture; and he was well advised in
        trusting to various natural timekeepers, such as the rising and
        setting of the constellations, the arrival and departure of the
        migratory birds, the flowering of certain plants,<a id="noteref_184"
        name="noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a> the
        ripening of fruits, and the setting in of the rains, rather than to
        the fallacious indications of the public calendar. It is by natural
        timekeepers, and not by calendar months, that Hesiod determines the
        seasons of the farmer's year in the poem which is the oldest existing
        treatise on husbandry.<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as the
        ploughman's prayer to Demeter, before he drove the share through the
        clods of the field, was taken up and reverberated, so to say, with a
        great volume of sound in the public prayers which the Athenian state
        annually offered to the goddess before the ploughing on behalf of the
        whole world, so the simple first-fruits of barley, presented to the
        rustic Demeter under the dappled shade of rustling poplars and elms
        on the threshing-floor in Cos, were repeated year by year on a
        grander scale in the first-fruits of the barley and wheat harvest,
        which were presented to the Corn Mother and the Corn Maiden at
        Eleusis, not merely by every husbandman in Attica, but by all the
        allies and subjects of Athens far and near, and even by many free
        Greek communities beyond the sea. The reason why year by year these
        offerings of grain poured from far countries into the public
        granaries at Eleusis, was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg
        054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        widespread belief that the gift of corn had been first bestowed by
        Demeter on the Athenians and afterwards disseminated by them among
        all mankind through the agency of Triptolemus, who travelled over the
        world in his dragon-drawn car teaching all peoples to plough the

        in a play called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        represented Demeter instructing the hero to carry the seed of the

        Italy,<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href=

        which we may infer that the cities of Magna Graecia were among the
        number of those that sent the thank-offering of barley and wheat
        every year to Athens. Again, in the fourth century before our era
        Xenophon represents Callias, the braggart Eleusinian Torchbearer,
        addressing the Lacedaemonians in a set speech, in which he declared
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“Our ancestor Triptolemus is said to
        have bestowed the seed of Demeter's corn on the Peloponese before any
        other land. How then,”</span> he asked with pathetic earnestness,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“can it be right that you should come to
        ravage the corn of the men from whom you received the
        seed?”</span><a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href=
        "#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a> Again,
        writing in the fourth century before our era Isocrates relates with a
        swell of patriotic pride how, in her search for her lost daughter
        Persephone, the goddess Demeter came to Attica and gave to the
        ancestors of the Athenians the two greatest of all gifts, the gift of
        the corn and the gift of the mysteries, of which the one reclaimed
        men from the life of beasts and the other held out hopes to them of a
        blissful eternity beyond the grave. The antiquity of the tradition,
        the orator proceeds to say, was no reason for rejecting it, but quite
        the contrary it furnished a strong argument in its favour, for what
        many affirmed and all had heard might be accepted as trustworthy.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And moreover,”</span> he adds, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we are not driven to rest our case merely on the
        venerable age of the tradition; we can appeal to stronger evidence in
        its support. For most of the cities send us every year the

        when any of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg

        send the due portions of the fruits and to act towards our city

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This testimony of
        Isocrates to the antiquity both of the legend and of the custom might
        perhaps have been set aside, or at least disparaged, as the empty
        bombast of a wordy rhetorician, if it had not happened by good chance
        to be amply confirmed by an official decree of the Athenian people
        passed in the century before Isocrates wrote. The decree was found
        inscribed on a stone at Eleusis and is dated by scholars in the
        latter half of the fifth century before our era, sometime between 446
        and 420 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        deals with the first-fruits of barley and wheat which were offered to
        the Two Goddesses, that is, to Demeter and Persephone, not only by
        the Athenians and their allies but by the Greeks in general. It
        prescribes the exact amount of barley and wheat which was to be
        offered by the Athenians and their allies, and it directs the highest
        officials at Eleusis, namely the Hierophant and the Torchbearer, to
        exhort the other Greeks at the mysteries to offer likewise of the
        first-fruits of the corn. The authority alleged in the decree for
        requiring or inviting offerings of first-fruits alike from Athenians
        and from foreigners is ancestral custom and the bidding of the
        Delphic oracle. The Senate is further enjoined to send commissioners,
        so far as it could be done, to all Greek cities whatsoever,
        exhorting, though not commanding, them to send the first-fruits in
        compliance with ancestral custom and the bidding of the Delphic
        oracle, and the state officials are directed to receive the offerings
        from such states in the same manner as the offerings of the Athenians
        and their allies. Instructions are also given for the building of
        three subterranean granaries at Eleusis, where the contributions of
        grain from Attica were to be stored. The best of the corn
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056"
        id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was to be offered in sacrifice
        as the Eumolpids might direct: oxen were to be bought and sacrificed,
        with gilt horns, not only to the two Goddesses but also to the God
        (Pluto), Triptolemus, Eubulus, and Athena; and the remainder of the
        grain was to be sold and with the produce votive offerings were to be
        dedicated with inscriptions setting forth that they had been
        dedicated from the offerings of first-fruits, and recording the names
        of all the Greeks who sent the offerings to Eleusis. The decree ends
        with a prayer that all who comply with these injunctions or
        exhortations and render their dues to the city of Athens and to the
        Two Goddesses, may enjoy prosperity together with good and abundant
        crops. Writing in the second century of our era, under the Roman
        empire, the rhetorician Aristides records the custom which the Greeks
        observed of sending year by year the first-fruits of the harvest to
        Athens in gratitude for the corn, but he speaks of the practice as a
        thing of the past.<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href=

        galleys had ceased to carry the terror of the Athenian arms into
        distant seas. But if the homage was no longer paid in the substantial
        shape of cargoes of grain, it continued down to the latest days of
        paganism to be paid in the cheaper form of gratitude for that
        inestimable benefit, which the Athenians claimed to have received
        from the Corn Goddess and to have liberally communicated to the rest
        of mankind. Even the Sicilians, who, inhabiting a fertile
        corn-growing island, worshipped Demeter and Persephone above all the
        gods and claimed to have been the first to receive the gift of the
        corn from the Corn Goddess,<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192"

        nevertheless freely acknowledged that the Athenians had spread,
        though they had not originated, the useful discovery among the
        nations. Thus the patriotic Sicilian historian Diodorus, while giving

        roamed over many parts of the world. Those people who received her
        best she rewarded by giving them in return the fruit of the wheat;
        and because the Athenians welcomed her most kindly of all, she
        bestowed the fruit of the wheat on them next after the Sicilians.
        Wherefore that people honoured the goddess more than any other folk
        by magnificent sacrifices and the mysteries at Eleusis, which for
        their extreme antiquity and sanctity have become famous among all
        men. From the Athenians many others received the boon of the corn and
        shared the seed with their neighbours, till they filled the whole
        inhabited earth with it. But as the people of Sicily, on account of
        the intimate relation in which they stood to Demeter and the Maiden,
        were the first to participate in the newly discovered corn, they
        appointed sacrifices and popular festivities in honour of each of the
        two goddesses, naming the celebrations after them and signifying the
        nature of the boons they had received by the dates of the festivals.
        For they celebrated the bringing home of the Maiden at the time when
        the corn was ripe, performing the sacrifice and holding the festivity
        with all the solemnity and zeal that might be reasonably expected of
        men who desired to testify their gratitude for so signal a gift
        bestowed on them before all the rest of mankind. But the sacrifice to
        Demeter they assigned to the time when the sowing of the corn begins;
        and for ten days they hold a popular festivity which bears the name
        of the goddess, and is remarkable as well for the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> magnificence of its pomp as for the
        costumes then worn in imitation of the olden time. During these days
        it is customary for people to rail at each other in foul language,
        because when Demeter was mourning for the rape of the Maiden she
        laughed at a ribald jest.”</span><a id="noteref_195" name=

        despite his natural prepossession in favour of his native land,
        Diodorus bears testimony both to the special blessing bestowed on the
        Athenians by the Corn Goddess, and to the generosity with which they
        had imparted the blessing to others, until it gradually spread to the
        ends of the earth. Again, Cicero, addressing a Roman audience,
        enumerates among the benefits which Athens was believed to have
        conferred on the world, the gift of the corn and its origin in Attic
        soil; and the cursory manner in which he alludes to it seems to prove
        that the tradition was familiar to his hearers.<a id="noteref_196"
        name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> Four
        centuries later the rhetorician Himerius speaks of Demeter's gift of
        the corn and the mysteries to the Athenians as the source of the
        first and greatest service rendered by their city to mankind;<a id=

        ancient, widespread, and persistent was the legend which ascribed the
        origin of the corn to the goddess Demeter and associated it with the
        institution of the Eleusinian mysteries. No wonder that the Delphic
        oracle called Athens <span class="tei tei-q">“the Metropolis of the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the passage
        of Diodorus which I have quoted we learn that the Sicilians
        celebrated the festival of Demeter at the beginning of sowing, and
        the festival of Persephone at harvest. This proves that they
        associated, if they did not identify, the Mother Goddess with the
        seed-corn and the Daughter Goddess with the ripe ears. Could any
        association or identification be more easy and obvious to people who
        personified the processes of nature under the form of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> anthropomorphic deities? As the seed
        brings forth the ripe ear, so the Corn Mother Demeter gave birth to
        the Corn Daughter Persephone. It is true that difficulties arise when
        we attempt to analyse this seemingly simple conception. How, for
        example, are we to divide exactly the two persons of the divinity? At
        what precise moment does the seed cease to be the Corn Mother and
        begins to burgeon out into the Corn Daughter? And how far can we
        identify the material substance of the barley and wheat with the
        divine bodies of the Two Goddesses? Questions of this sort probably
        gave little concern to the sturdy swains who ploughed, sowed, and
        reaped the fat fields of Sicily. We cannot imagine that their night's
        rest was disturbed by uneasy meditations on these knotty problems. It
        would hardly be strange if the muzzy mind of the Sicilian bumpkin,
        who looked with blind devotion to the Two Goddesses for his daily
        bread, totally failed to distinguish Demeter from the seed and
        Persephone from the ripe sheaves, and if he accepted implicitly the
        doctrine of the real presence of the divinities in the corn without
        discriminating too curiously between the material and the spiritual
        properties of the barley or the wheat. And if he had been closely
        questioned by a rigid logician as to the exact distinction to be
        drawn between the two persons of the godhead who together represented
        for him the annual vicissitudes of the cereals, Hodge might have
        scratched his head and confessed that it puzzled him to say where
        precisely the one goddess ended and the other began, or why the seed
        buried in the ground should figure at one time as the dead daughter
        Persephone descending into the nether world, and at another as the
        living Mother Demeter about to give birth to next year's crop.
        Theological subtleties like these have posed longer heads than are
        commonly to be found on bucolic shoulders.</p>

        there is nothing to shew that the offerings were made immediately

        of the Threshing-floor was intimately connected with the worship both
        of Demeter and of Dionysus, and accordingly it deserves our
        attention. It is said to have been sacred to both these

        while the name seems to connect it rather with the Corn Goddess than
        with the Wine God, we are yet informed that it was held by the
        Athenians on the occasion of the pruning of the vines and the tasting
        of the stored-up wine.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href=

        festival is frequently mentioned in Eleusinian inscriptions, from
        some of which we gather that it included sacrifices to the two
        goddesses and a so-called Ancestral Contest, as to the nature of
        which we have no information.<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204"

        Triptolemus was the hero who is said to have diffused the knowledge
        of the corn all over the world, nothing could be more natural than
        that the Festival of the Threshing-floor should be held on the sacred
        threshing-floor which bore his name. As for Demeter, we have already
        seen how intimate was her association with the threshing-floor and
        the operation of threshing; according to Homer, she is the yellow
        goddess who parts the yellow grain from the white chaff at the
        threshing, and in Cos her image with the corn-stalks and the poppies
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062"

        special use was made, as we have seen, of the first-fruits of the
        corn. With regard to the dating of the festival we are informed that
        it fell in the month Poseideon, which corresponds roughly to our
        December, and as the date rests on the high authority of the ancient
        Athenian antiquary Philochorus,<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208"

        bound to accept it. But it is certainly surprising to find a Festival
        of the Threshing-floor held so late in the year, long after the
        threshing, which in Greece usually takes place not later than
        midsummer, though on high ground in Crete it is sometimes prolonged
        till near the end of August.<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210"

        bound to conclude that the Festival of the Threshing-floor was quite
        distinct from the actual threshing of the corn.<a id="noteref_211"

        said to have included certain mystic rites performed by women alone,
        who feasted and quaffed wine, while they broke filthy jests on each
        other and exhibited cakes baked in the form of the male and female
        organs of generation.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href=

        mere wanton outbursts of licentious passion, but were deliberately
        practised as rites calculated to promote the fertility of the ground
        by means of homoeopathic or imitative magic. A like association of

        with rites intended to promote the growth of the crops meets us in
        the Thesmophoria, a festival of Demeter celebrated by women alone, at
        which the character of the goddess as a source of fertility comes out
        clearly in the custom of mixing the remains of the sacrificial pigs

        these epithets it may be remarked that though all of them are quite

        sanctuary of Eleusis down to the beginning of the nineteenth century.
        For when the English traveller Dodwell revisited Eleusis, the
        inhabitants lamented to him the loss of a colossal image of Demeter,
        which was carried off by Clarke in 1802 and presented to the
        University of Cambridge, where it still remains. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In my first journey to Greece,”</span> says Dodwell,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“this protecting deity was in its full glory,
        situated in the centre of a threshing-floor, amongst the ruins of her
        temple. The villagers were impressed with a persuasion that their
        rich harvests were the effect of her bounty, and since her removal,
        their abundance, as they assured me, has disappeared.”</span><a id=

        dispensing corn to her worshippers in the nineteenth century of the
        Christian era, precisely as her image stood and dispensed corn to her
        worshippers on the threshing-floor of Cos in the days of Theocritus.
        And just as the people of Eleusis last century attributed the
        diminution of their harvests to the loss of the image of Demeter, so
        in antiquity the Sicilians, a corn-growing people devoted to the
        worship of the two Corn Goddesses, lamented that the crops of many
        towns had perished because the unscrupulous Roman governor Verres had
        impiously carried off the image of Demeter from her famous temple at
        Henna.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a former part
        of this work I followed an eminent French scholar in concluding, from
        various indications, that part of the religious drama performed in
        the mysteries of Eleusis may have been a marriage between the sky-god
        Zeus and the corn-goddess Demeter, represented by the hierophant and
        the priestess of the goddess respectively.<a id="noteref_231" name=

        conclusion is arrived at by combining a number of passages, all more
        or less vague and indefinite, of late Christian writers; hence it
        must remain to some extent uncertain and cannot at the best lay claim
        to more than a fair degree of probability. It may be, as Professor W.
        Ridgeway holds, that this dramatic marriage of the god and goddess
        was an innovation foisted into the Eleusinian Mysteries in that great
        welter of religions which followed the meeting of the East and the
        West in the later ages of antiquity.<a id="noteref_232" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a> If a
        marriage of Zeus and Demeter did indeed form an important feature of
        the Mysteries in the fifth century before our era, it is certainly
        remarkable, as Professor Ridgeway has justly pointed out, that no
        mention of Zeus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg
        066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        occurs in the public decree of that century which regulates the
        offerings of first-fruits and the sacrifices to be made to the gods
        and goddesses of Eleusis.<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href=
        "#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> At the
        same time we must bear in mind that, if the evidence for the ritual
        marriage of Zeus and Demeter is late and doubtful, the evidence for
        the myth is ancient and indubitable. The story was known to Homer,
        for in the list of beauties to whom he makes Zeus, in a burst of
        candour, confess that he had lost his too susceptible heart, there
        occurs the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“the fair-haired Queen
        Demeter”</span>;<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href=
        "#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a> and in
        another passage the poet represents the jealous god smiting with a
        thunderbolt the favoured lover with whom the goddess had forgotten
        her dignity among the furrows of a fallow field.<a id="noteref_235"
        name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a>
        Moreover, according to one tradition, Dionysus himself was the
        offspring of the intrigue between Zeus and Demeter.<a id=
        "noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a> Thus
        there is no intrinsic improbability in the view that one or other of
        these unedifying incidents in the backstairs chronicle of Olympus
        should have formed part of the sacred peep-show in the Eleusinian
        Mysteries. But it seems just possible that the marriage to which the
        Christian writers allude with malicious joy may after all have been
        of a more regular and orthodox pattern. We are positively told that
        the rape of Persephone was acted at the Mysteries;<a id="noteref_237"
        name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a> may
        that scene not have been followed by another representing the
        solemnisation of her nuptials with her ravisher and husband Pluto? It
        is to be remembered that Pluto was sometimes known as a god of
        fertility under the title of Subterranean Zeus. It was to him under
        that title as well as to Demeter, that the Greek ploughman prayed at
        the beginning of the ploughing;<a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238"
        href="#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a> and the
        people of Myconus used to sacrifice to Subterranean Zeus and
        Subterranean Earth for the prosperity of the crops on the twelfth day
        of the month Lenaeon.<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href=
        "#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a> Thus it
        may be that the Zeus whose marriage was dramatically represented at
        the Mysteries was not the sky-god Zeus, but his <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> brother Zeus of the Underworld, and that
        the writers who refer to the ceremony have confused the two brothers.
        This view, if it could be established, would dispose of the
        difficulty raised by the absence of the name of Zeus in the decree
        which prescribes the offerings to be made to the gods of Eleusis; for
        although in that decree Pluto is not mentioned under the name of
        Subterranean Zeus, he is clearly referred to, as the editors of the
        inscription have seen, under the vague title of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the God,”</span> while his consort Persephone is
        similarly referred to under the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        Goddess,”</span> and it is ordained that perfect victims shall be
        sacrificed to both of them. However, if we thus dispose of one
        difficulty, it must be confessed that in doing so we raise another.
        For if the bridegroom in the Sacred Marriage at Eleusis was not the
        sky-god Zeus, but the earth-god Pluto, we seem driven to suppose
        that, contrary to the opinion of the reverend Christian
        scandal-mongers, the bride was his lawful wife Persephone and not his
        sister and mother-in-law Demeter. In short, on the hypothesis which I
        have suggested we are compelled to conclude that the ancient
        busybodies who lifted the veil from the mystic marriage were mistaken
        as to the person both of the divine bridegroom and of the divine
        bride. In regard to the bridegroom I have conjectured that they may
        have confused the two brothers, Zeus of the Upper World and Zeus of
        the Lower World. In regard to the bride, can any reason be suggested
        for confounding the persons of the mother and daughter? On the view
        here taken of the nature of Demeter and Persephone nothing could be
        easier than to confuse them with each other, for both of them were
        mythical embodiments of the corn, the mother Demeter standing for the
        old corn of last year and the daughter Persephone standing for the
        new corn of this year. In point of fact Greek artists, both of the
        archaic and of later periods, frequently represent the Mother and
        Daughter side by side in forms which resemble each other so closely
        that eminent modern experts have sometimes differed from each other
        on the question, which is Demeter and which is Persephone; indeed in
        some cases it might be quite impossible to distinguish the two if it
        were not for the inscriptions attached to the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> figures.<a id="noteref_240" name=
        "noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> The
        ancient sculptors, vase-painters, and engravers must have had some
        good reason for portraying the two goddesses in types which are
        almost indistinguishable from each other; and what better reason
        could they have had than the knowledge that the two persons of the
        godhead were one in substance, that they stood merely for two
        different aspects of the same simple natural phenomenon, the growth
        of the corn? Thus it is easy to understand why Demeter and Persephone
        may have been confused in ritual as well as in art, why in particular
        the part of the divine bride in a Sacred Marriage may sometimes have
        been assigned to the Mother and sometimes to the Daughter. But all
        this, I fully admit, is a mere speculation, and I only put it forward
        as such. We possess far too little information as to a Sacred
        Marriage in the Eleusinian Mysteries to be justified in speaking with
        confidence on so obscure a subject.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One thing,
        however, which we may say with a fair degree of probability is that,
        if such a marriage did take place at Eleusis, no date in the
        agricultural year could well have been more appropriate for it than
        the date at which the Mysteries actually fell, namely about the
        middle of September. The long Greek summer is practically rainless
        and in the fervent heat and unbroken drought all nature languishes.
        The river-beds are dry, the fields parched. The farmer awaits
        impatiently the setting-in of the autumnal rains, which begin in
        October and mark the great season for ploughing and sowing. What time
        could be fitter for celebrating the union of the Corn Goddess with
        her husband the Earth God or perhaps rather with her paramour the Sky
        God, who will soon descend in fertilising showers to quicken the seed
        in the furrows? Such embraces of the divine powers or their human
        representatives might well be deemed, on the principles of
        homoeopathic or imitative magic, indispensable to the growth of the
        crops. At least similar ideas have been entertained and similar
        customs have been practised by many peoples;<a id="noteref_241" name=

        to catch a glimpse of rude rites of the same sort performed in the
        fields at sowing-time by Greek ploughmen for the sake of ensuring the
        growth of the seed which they were about to commit to the bosom of
        the naked earth. In this connexion a statement of ancient writers as
        to the rites of Eleusis receives fresh significance. We are told that
        at these rites the worshippers looked up to the sky and cried
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Rain!”</span> and then looked down at the

        or Corn Goddess than such invocations to the heaven to pour down rain
        and to the earth or the corn to conceive seed under the fertilising
        shower; in Greece no time could well be more suitable for

        from an inscription dated about the close of the third century before
        our era we learn that at the Great Eleusinian Games sacrifices were
        offered to Demeter and Persephone.<a id="noteref_250" name=

        Further, we gather from an official Athenian inscription of 329
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> that both the Great and
        the Lesser Games included athletic and musical contests, a
        horse-race, and a competition which bore the name of the Ancestral or
        Hereditary Contest, and which accordingly may well have formed the
        original kernel of the games.<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251"

        Unfortunately nothing is known about this Ancestral Contest. We might
        be tempted to identify it with the Ancestral Contest included in the
        Eleusinian Festival of the Threshing-floor,<a id="noteref_252" name=
        "noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on

        identification could be proved, we should have another confirmation
        of the tradition which connects the games with Demeter and the corn;
        for according to the prevalent tradition it was to Triptolemus that
        Demeter first revealed the secret of the corn, and it was he whom she
        sent out as an itinerant missionary to impart the beneficent
        discovery of the cereals to all mankind and to teach them to sow the
        seed.<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href=

        monuments of art, especially in vase-paintings, he is constantly
        represented along with Demeter in this capacity, holding corn-stalks
        in his hand and sitting in his car, which is sometimes winged and
        sometimes drawn by dragons, and from which he is said to have sowed
        the seed down on the whole world as he sped through the air.<a id=

        short, if we may judge from the combined testimony of Greek
        literature and art, Triptolemus was the corn-hero first and foremost.
        Even beyond the limits of the Greek world, all men, we are told,
        founded sanctuaries and erected altars in his honour because he had
        bestowed on them the gift of the corn.<a id="noteref_257" name=

        it would seem as if Triptolemus, like Demeter and Persephone
        themselves, were a purely mythical being, an embodiment of the
        conception of the first sower. At all events in the local Eleusinian
        legend, according to an eminent scholar, who has paid special
        attention to Attic genealogy, <span class="tei tei-q">“Triptolemus
        does not, like his comrade Eumolpus or other founders of Eleusinian
        priestly families, continue his kind, but without leaving offspring
        who might perpetuate his priestly office, he is removed from the
        scene of his beneficent activity. As he appeared, so he vanishes

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, there is

        uncertain. But a clear trace of such a connexion may be seen in the
        custom of rewarding the victors in the Eleusinian games with measures
        of barley; in the official Athenian inscription of 329 <span class=

        "page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Eleusinian games were closely connected with
        the worship of Demeter and Persephone. The grain thus distributed in
        prizes was probably reaped on the Rarian plain near Eleusis, where
        according to the legend Triptolemus sowed the first corn.<a id=

        which we may reasonably infer that the prizes of barley, to which no
        doubt a certain sanctity attached in the popular mind, were brought
        from the same holy fields. So sacred was the Rarian plain that no
        dead body was allowed to defile it. When such a pollution
        accidentally took place, it was expiated by the sacrifice of a
        pig,<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, so far as
        the scanty evidence at our disposal permits us to judge, the
        Eleusinian games, like the Eleusinian Mysteries, would seem to have
        been primarily concerned with Demeter and Persephone as goddesses of
        the corn. At least that is expressly affirmed by the old scholiast on
        Pindar and it is borne out by the practice of rewarding the victors
        with measures of barley. Perhaps the Ancestral Contest, which may
        well have formed the original nucleus of the games, was a contest
        between the reapers on the sacred Rarian plain to see who should
        finish his allotted task before his fellows. For success in such a
        contest no prize could be more appropriate than a measure of the
        sacred barley which the victorious reaper had just cut on the
        barley-field. In the sequel we shall see that similar contests
        between reapers have been common on the harvest fields of modern
        Europe, and it will appear that such competitions are not purely
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075"
        id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> athletic; their aim is not
        simply to demonstrate the superior strength, activity, and skill of
        the victors; it is to secure for the particular farm the possession
        of the blooming young Corn-maiden of the present year, conceived as
        the embodiment of the vigorous grain, and to pass on to laggard
        neighbours the aged Corn-mother of the past year, conceived as an
        embodiment of the effete and outworn energies of the corn.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> May it
        not have been so at Eleusis? may not the reapers have vied with each
        other for possession of the young corn-spirit Persephone and for
        avoidance of the old corn-spirit Demeter? may not the prize of
        barley, which rewarded the victor in the Ancestral Contest, have been
        supposed to house in the ripe ears no less a personage than the
        Corn-maiden Persephone herself? And if there is any truth in these
        conjectures (for conjectures they are and nothing more), we may
        hazard a guess as to the other Ancestral Contest which took place at
        the Eleusinian Festival of the Threshing-floor. Perhaps it in like
        manner was originally a competition between threshers on the sacred
        threshing-floor of Triptolemus to determine who should finish
        threshing his allotted quantity of corn before the rest. Such
        competitions have also been common, as we shall see presently, on the
        threshing-floors of modern Europe, and their motive again has not
        been simple emulation between sturdy swains for the reward of
        strength and dexterity; it has been a dread of being burdened with
        the aged and outworn spirit of the corn conceived as present in the
        bundle of corn-stalks which receives the last stroke at
        threshing.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href=
        "#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> Perhaps
        at the conclusion of the threshing these effigies, as representatives
        of the old Corn-spirit, were passed on to neighbours who had not yet
        finished threshing the corn. At least the supposition is in harmony
        with modern customs observed on the threshing-floor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is possible
        that the Eleusinian games were no more than a popular merrymaking
        celebrated at the close of the harvest. This view of their character
        might be supported by modern analogies; for in some parts of Germany
        it has been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg
        076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        customary for the harvesters, when their work is done, to engage in
        athletic competitions of various kinds, which have at first sight no
        very obvious connexion with the business of harvesting. For example,
        at Besbau near Luckau great cakes were baked at the harvest-festival,
        and the labourers, both men and women, ran races for them. He or she
        who reached them first received not only a cake, but a handkerchief
        or the like as a prize. Again, at Bergkirchen, when the harvest was
        over, a garland was hung up and the harvesters rode at it on
        horseback and tried to bring it down with a stab or a blow as they
        galloped past. He who succeeded in bringing it down was proclaimed
        King. Again, in the villages near Fürstenwald at harvest the young
        men used to fetch a fir-tree from the wood, peel the trunk, and set
        it up like a mast in the middle of the village. A handkerchief and
        other prizes were fastened to the top of the pole and the men
        clambered up for them.<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href=
        "#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a> Among
        the peasantry of Silesia, we are told, the harvest-home broadened out
        into a popular festival, in which athletic sports figured
        prominently. Thus, for example, at Järischau, in the Strehlitz
        district, a scythe, a rake, a flail, and a hay-fork or pitchfork were
        fastened to the top of a smooth pole and awarded as prizes, in order
        of merit, to the men who displayed most agility in climbing the pole.
        Younger men amused themselves with running in sacks, high jumps, and
        so forth. At Prauss, near Nimptsch, the girls ran a race in a field
        for aprons as prizes. In the central parts of Silesia a favourite
        amusement at harvest was a race between girls for a garland of leaves
        or flowers.<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href=
        "#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> Yet it
        seems probable that all such sports at harvest were in origin not
        mere pastimes, but that they were serious attempts to secure in one
        way or another the help and blessing of the corn-spirit. Thus in some
        parts of Prussia, at the close of the rye-harvest, a few sheaves used
        to be left standing in the field after all the rest of the rye had
        been carted home. These sheaves were then made up into the shape of a
        man and dressed out in masculine costume, and all the young women
        were obliged to run a race, of which the corn-man <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was the goal. She who won the race led
        off the dancing in the evening.<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270"
        href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> Here
        the aim of the foot-race among the young women is clearly to secure
        the corn-spirit embodied in the last sheaf left standing on the
        field; for, as we shall see later on, the last sheaf is commonly
        supposed to harbour the corn-spirit and is treated accordingly like a
        man or a woman.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the Ancestral
        Contest at the Eleusinian games was, as I have conjectured, a contest
        between the reapers on the sacred barley-field, we should have to
        suppose that the games were celebrated at barley-harvest, which in
        the lowlands of Greece falls in May or even at the end of April. This
        theory is in harmony with the evidence of the scholiast on Pindar,
        who tells us that the Eleusinian games were celebrated after the
        corn-harvest.<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href=

        other ancient authority, so far as I am aware, mentions at what time
        of the year these games were held. Modern authorities, arguing from
        certain slight and to some extent conjectural data, have variously
        assigned them to Metageitnion (August) and to Boedromion (September),
        and those who assign them to Boedromion (September) are divided in
        opinion as to whether they preceded or followed the Mysteries.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is a
        serious difficulty in the way of connecting the Eleusinian games with
        the goddesses of the corn. How is the quadriennial or the biennial
        period of the games to be reconciled with the annual growth of the
        crops? Year by year the barley and the wheat are sown and reaped; how

        id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> then could the games, held
        only every fourth or every second year, have been regarded as
        thank-offerings for the annual harvest? On this view of their nature,
        which is the one taken by the old scholiast on Pindar, though the
        harvest was received at the hands of the Corn Goddess punctually
        every year, men thanked her for her bounty only every second year or
        even only every fourth year. What were her feelings likely to be in
        the blank years when she got no thanks and no games? She might
        naturally resent such negligence and ingratitude and punish them by
        forbidding the seed to sprout, just as she did at Eleusis when she
        mourned the loss of her daughter. In short, men could hardly expect
        to reap crops in years in which they offered nothing to the Corn
        Goddess. That would indeed appear to be the view generally taken by
        the ancient Greeks; for we have seen that year by year they presented
        the first-fruits of the barley and the wheat to Demeter, not merely
        in the solemn state ritual of Eleusis, but also in rustic festivals
        held by farmers on their threshing-floors. The pious Greek husbandman
        would no doubt have been shocked and horrified at a proposal to pay
        the Corn Goddess her dues only every second or fourth year.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“No offerings, no crops,”</span> he would say
        to himself, and would anticipate nothing but dearth and famine in any
        year when he failed to satisfy the just and lawful demands of the
        divinity on whose good pleasure he believed the growth of the corn to
        be directly dependent. Accordingly we may regard it as highly
        probable that from the very beginning of settled and regular
        agriculture in Greece men annually propitiated the deities of the
        corn with a ritual of some sort, and rendered them their dues in the
        shape of offerings of the ripe barley and wheat. Now we know that the
        Mysteries of Eleusis were celebrated every year, and accordingly, if
        I am right in interpreting them as essentially a dramatic
        representation of the annual vicissitudes of the corn performed for
        the purpose of quickening the seed, it becomes probable that in some
        form or another they were annually held at Eleusis long before the
        practice arose of celebrating games there every fourth or every
        second year. In short, the Eleusinian mysteries were in all
        probability <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg
        079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> far
        older than the Eleusinian games. How old they were we cannot even
        guess. But when we consider that the cultivation of barley and wheat,
        the two cereals specially associated with Demeter, appears to have
        been practised in prehistoric Europe from the Stone Age
        onwards,<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href=
        "#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a> we
        shall be disposed to admit that the annual performance of religious
        or magical rites at Eleusis for the purpose of ensuring good crops,
        whether by propitiating the Corn Goddess with offerings of
        first-fruits or by dramatically representing the sowing and the
        growth of the corn in mythical form, probably dates from an extremely
        remote antiquity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in order to
        clear our ideas on this subject it is desirable to ascertain, if
        possible, the reason for holding the Eleusinian games at intervals of
        two or four years. The reason for holding a harvest festival and
        thanksgiving every year is obvious enough; but why hold games only
        every second or every fourth year? The reason for such limitations is
        by no means obvious on the face of them, especially if the growth of
        the crops is deemed dependent on the celebration. In order to find an
        answer to this question it may be well at the outset to confine our
        attention to the Great Eleusinian Games, which were celebrated only
        every fourth year. That these were the principal games appears not
        only from their name, but from the testimony of Aristotle, or at
        least of the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        all celebrated at quadriennial or, as the Greeks called them,
        penteteric periods; and at a later time when Augustus instituted, or
        rather renewed on a more splendid scale, the games at Actium to
        commemorate his great victory, he followed a well-established Greek
        precedent by ordaining that they should be quadriennial.<a id=

        certainly this is attested for the Pythian games,<a id="noteref_279"

        added together make up eight solar years, seems to prove that the
        Olympic cycle of four years was really based on a cycle of eight
        years, from which it is natural to infer that in the beginning the
        Olympic, like the Pythian, games may have been octennial instead of
        quadriennial.<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href=

        know from the testimony of the ancients themselves that the Greeks
        instituted the eight-years' cycle for the purpose of harmonising

        regulated their calendar primarily by observation of the moon rather
        than of the sun; their months were lunar, and their ordinary year
        consisted of twelve lunar <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg
        081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        months. But the solar year of three hundred and sixty-five and a
        quarter days exceeds the lunar year of twelve lunar months or three
        hundred and fifty-four days by eleven and a quarter days, so that in
        eight solar years the excess amounts to ninety days or roughly three
        lunar months. Accordingly the Greeks equated eight solar years to
        eight lunar years of twelve months each by intercalating three lunar
        months of thirty days each in the octennial cycle; they intercalated
        one lunar month in the third year of the cycle, a second lunar month
        in the fifth year, and a third lunar month in the eighth year.<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> In this
        way they, so to say, made the sun and moon keep time together by
        reckoning ninety-nine lunar months as equivalent to eight solar
        years; so that if, for example, the full moon coincided with the
        summer solstice in one year, it coincided with it again after the
        revolution of the eight years' cycle, but not before. The equation
        was indeed not quite exact, and in order to render it so the Greeks
        afterwards found themselves obliged, first, to intercalate three days
        every sixteen years, and, next, to omit one intercalary month in
        every period of one hundred and sixty years.<a id="noteref_284" name=

        these corrections were doubtless refinements of a later age; they may
        have been due to the astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus, or to Cleostratus
        of Tenedos, who were variously, but incorrectly, supposed to have

        are strong grounds for holding that in its simplest form the
        octennial cycle of ninety-nine lunar months dates from an extremely
        remote antiquity in Greece; that it was in fact, as a well-informed
        Greek writer tell us,<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href=

        first systematic attempt to bring solar and the lunar time into
        harmony. Indeed, if the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg
        082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Olympiads were calculated, as they appear to have been, on the eight
        years' cycle, this of itself suffices to place the origin of the
        cycle not later than 776 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, the year with which
        the reckoning by Olympiads begins. And when we bear in mind the very
        remote period from which, judged by the wonderful remains of Mycenae,
        Tiryns, Cnossus and other cities, civilisation in Greek lands appears
        to date, it seems reasonable to suppose that the octennial cycle,
        based as it was on very simple observations, for which nothing but
        good eyes and almost no astronomical knowledge was necessary,<a id=

        have been handed down among the inhabitants of these countries from
        ages that preceded by many centuries, possibly by thousands of years,
        the great period of Greek literature and art. The supposition is
        confirmed by the traces which the octennial cycle has left of itself
        in certain ancient Greek customs and superstitions, particularly by
        the evidence which points to the conclusion that at two of the oldest
        seats of monarchy in Greece, namely Cnossus and Sparta, the king's
        tenure of office was formerly limited to eight years.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are informed,
        and may readily believe, that the motive which led the Greeks to
        adopt the eight years' cycle was religious rather than practical or
        scientific: their aim was not so much to ensure the punctual despatch
        of business or to solve an abstract problem in astronomy, as to
        ascertain the exact days on which they ought to sacrifice to the
        gods. For the Greeks regularly employed lunar months in their
        reckonings,<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href=
        "#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> and
        accordingly if they had dated their religious festivals simply by the
        number of the month and the day of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the month, the excess of eleven and a quarter
        days of the solar over the lunar year would have had the effect of
        causing the festivals gradually to revolve throughout the whole
        circle of the seasons, so that in time ceremonies which properly
        belonged to winter would come to be held in summer, and on the
        contrary ceremonies which were only appropriate to summer would come
        to be held in winter. To avoid this anomaly, and to ensure that
        festivals dated by lunar months should fall at fixed or nearly fixed
        points in the solar year, the Greeks adopted the octennial cycle by
        the simple expedient of intercalating three lunar months in every
        period of eight years. In doing so they acted, as one of their
        writers justly pointed out, on a principle precisely the reverse of
        that followed by the ancient Egyptians, who deliberately regulated
        their religious festivals by a purely lunar calendar for the purpose
        of allowing them gradually to revolve throughout the whole circle of
        the seasons.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus at an early
        stage of culture the regulation of the calendar is largely an affair
        of religion: it is a means of maintaining the established relations
        between gods and men on a satisfactory footing; and in public opinion
        the great evil of a disordered calendar is not so much that it
        disturbs and disarranges the ordinary course of business and the
        various transactions of civil life, as that it endangers the welfare
        or even the existence both of individuals and of the community by
        interrupting their normal intercourse with those divine powers on
        whose favour men believe themselves to be absolutely dependent. Hence
        in states which take this view of the deep religious import of the
        calendar its superintendence is naturally entrusted to priests rather
        than to astronomers, because the science of astronomy is regarded
        merely as ancillary to the deeper mysteries of theology. For example,
        at Rome the method of determining the months and regulating the
        festivals was a secret which the pontiffs for ages jealously guarded
        from the profane vulgar; and in consequence of their ignorance and
        incapacity the calendar fell into confusion and the festivals were
        celebrated out of their natural seasons, until the greatest of all

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole,
        then, it appears probable that the octennial cycle, based on
        considerations of religion and on elementary observations of the two
        great luminaries, dated from a very remote period among the ancient
        Greeks; if they did not bring it with them when they migrated
        southwards from the oakwoods and beechwoods of Central Europe, they
        may well have taken it over from their civilised predecessors of
        different blood and different language whom they found leading a
        settled agricultural life on the lands about the Aegean Sea. Now we
        have seen reasons to hold that the two most famous of the great Greek
        games, the Pythian and the Olympian, were both based on the ancient
        cycle of eight years, and that the quadriennial period at which they
        were regularly celebrated in historical times was arrived at by a
        subdivision of the older octennial cycle. It is hardly rash,
        therefore, to conjecture that the quadriennial period in general,
        regarded as the normal period for the celebration of great games and
        festivals, was originally founded on elementary religious and
        astronomical considerations of the same kind, that is, on a somewhat
        crude attempt to harmonise the discrepancies of solar and lunar time
        and thereby to ensure the continued favour of the gods. It is,
        indeed, certain or probable that some of these quadriennial festivals
        were celebrated in honour of the dead;<a id="noteref_292" name=

        there seems to be nothing in the beliefs or customs of the ancient
        Greeks concerning the dead which would suggest a quadriennial period
        as an appropriate one for propitiating the ghosts of the departed. At
        first sight it is different with the octennial period; for according
        to Pindar, the souls of the dead who had been purged of their guilt
        by an abode of eight years in the nether world were born again on
        earth in the ninth year as glorious kings, athletes, and sages.<a id=

        this belief in the reincarnation of the dead after eight years were
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085"
        id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> primitive, it might certainly
        furnish an excellent reason for honouring the ghosts of great men at
        their graves every eight years in order to facilitate their rebirth
        into the world. Yet the period of eight years thus rigidly applied to
        the life of disembodied spirits appears too arbitrary and
        conventional to be really primitive, and we may suspect that in this
        application it was nothing but an inference drawn from the old
        octennial cycle, which had been instituted for the purpose of
        reconciling solar and lunar time. If that was so, it will follow that
        the quadriennial period of funeral games was, like the similar period
        of other religious festivals, obtained through the bisection of the
        octennial cycle, and hence that it was ultimately derived from
        astronomical considerations rather than from any beliefs touching a
        quadriennial revolution in the state of the dead. Yet in historical
        times it may well have happened that these considerations were
        forgotten, and that games and festivals were instituted at
        quadriennial intervals, for example at Plataea<a id="noteref_294"

        any conscious reference to the sun and moon, and merely because that
        period had from time immemorial been regarded as the proper and
        normal one for the celebration of certain solemn religious rites.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we enquire why
        the Greeks so often bisected the old octennial period into two
        quadriennial periods for purposes of religion, the answer can only be
        conjectural, for no positive information appears to be given us on
        the subject by ancient writers. Perhaps they thought that eight years
        was too long a time to elapse between the solemn services, and that
        it was desirable to propitiate the deities at shorter intervals. But
        it is possible that political as well as religious motives may have
        operated to produce the change. We have seen reason to think that at
        two of the oldest seats of monarchy in Greece, namely Cnossus and
        Sparta, kings formerly held office for periods of eight years only,
        after which their sovereignty either terminated or had to be formally
        renewed. Now with the gradual growth of that democratic <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sentiment, which ultimately dominated
        Greek political life, men would become more and more jealous of the
        kingly power and would seek to restrict it within narrower limits,
        and one of the most obvious means of doing so was to shorten the
        king's tenure of office. We know that this was done at Athens, where
        the dynasty of the Medontids was reduced from the rank of monarchs
        for life to that of magistrates holding office for ten years
        only.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href=
        "#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> It is
        possible that elsewhere the king's reign was cut down from eight
        years to four years; and if I am right in my explanation of the
        origin of the Olympic games this political revolution actually took
        place at Olympia, where the victors in the chariot-race would seem at
        first to have personated the Sun-god and perhaps held office in the
        capacity of divine kings during the intervals between successive
        celebrations of the games.<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297"
        href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a> If at
        Olympia and elsewhere the games were of old primarily contests in
        which the king had personally to take part for the purpose of
        attesting his bodily vigour and therefore his capacity for office,
        the repetition of the test at intervals of four instead of eight
        years might be regarded as furnishing a better guarantee of the
        maintenance of the king's efficiency and thereby of the general
        welfare, which in primitive society is often supposed to be
        sympathetically bound up with the health and strength of the
        king.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while many of
        the great Greek games were celebrated at intervals of four years,
        others, such as the Nemean and the Isthmian, were celebrated at
        intervals of two years only; and just as the quadriennial period
        seems to have been arrived at through a bisection of the octennial
        period, so we may surmise that the biennial period was produced by a
        bisection of the quadriennial period. This was the view which the
        admirable modern chronologer L. Ideler took of the origin of the
        quadriennial and biennial festivals respectively,<a id="noteref_298"

        appears far more probable than the contrary opinion of the ancient
        chronologer Censorinus, that the quadriennial period was reached by
        doubling the biennial, and the octennial period by doubling
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087"

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> The
        theory of Censorinus was that the Greeks started with a biennial
        cycle of twelve and thirteen lunar months alternately in successive
        years for the purpose of harmonising solar and lunar time.<a id=

        discrepancy which it leaves between the two great celestial clocks,
        the sun and moon, was too glaring to escape the observation even of
        simple farmers, who would soon have been painfully sensible that the
        times were out of joint, if they had attempted to regulate the
        various operations of the agricultural year by reference to so very
        inaccurate an almanac. It is unlikely, therefore, that the Greeks
        ever made much use of a biennial cycle of this sort.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now to apply these
        conclusions to the Eleusinian games, which furnished the
        starting-point for the preceding discussion. Whatever the origin and
        meaning of these games may have been, we may surmise that the
        quadriennial and biennial periods at which they were held were
        originally derived from astronomical considerations, and that they
        had nothing to do directly either with the agricultural cycle, which
        is annual, nor with the worship of the dead, which can scarcely be
        said to have any cycle at all, unless indeed it be an annual one. In
        other words, neither the needs of husbandry nor the superstitions
        relating to ghosts furnish any natural explanation of the
        quadriennial and biennial periods of the Eleusinian games, and to
        discover such an explanation we are obliged to fall back on astronomy
        or, to be more exact, on that blend of astronomy with religion which
        appears to be mainly responsible for such Greek festivals as exceed a
        year in their period. To admit this is not to decide the question
        whether the Eleusinian games were agricultural or funereal in
        character; but it is implicitly to acknowledge that the games were of
        later origin than the annual ceremonies, including the Great
        Mysteries, which were designed to propitiate the deities of the corn
        for the very simple and practical purpose of ensuring good crops
        within the year. For it cannot but be that men <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> observed and laid their account with the
        annual changes of the seasons, especially as manifested by the growth
        and maturity of the crops, long before they attempted to reconcile
        the discrepancies of solar and lunar time by a series of observations
        extending over several years.</p>

        incline to agree with the most learned of ancient antiquaries, the
        Roman Varro, who, to quote Augustine's report of his opinion,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“interpreted the whole of the Eleusinian
        mysteries as relating to the corn which Ceres (Demeter) had
        discovered, and to Proserpine (Persephone), whom Pluto had carried
        off from her. And Proserpine herself, he said, signifies the
        fecundity of the seeds, the failure of which at a certain time had
        caused the earth to mourn for barrenness, and therefore had given
        rise to the opinion that the daughter of Ceres, that is, fecundity
        itself, had been ravished by Pluto and detained in the nether world;
        and when the dearth had been publicly mourned and fecundity had
        returned once more, there was gladness at the return of Proserpine
        and solemn rites were instituted accordingly. After that he
        says,”</span> continues Augustine, reporting Varro, <span class=

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far I have
        for the most part assumed an identity of nature between Demeter and
        Persephone, the divine mother and daughter personifying the corn in
        its double aspect of the seed-corn of last year and the ripe ears of
        this, and I pointed out that this view of the substantial unity of
        mother and daughter is borne out by their portraits <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in Greek art, which are often so alike as
        to be indistinguishable. Such a close resemblance between the
        artistic types of Demeter and Persephone militates decidedly against
        the view that the two goddesses are mythical embodiments of two
        things so different and so easily distinguishable from each other as
        the earth and the vegetation which springs from it. Had Greek artists
        accepted that view of Demeter and Persephone, they could surely have
        devised types of them which would have brought out the deep
        distinction between the goddesses. That they were capable of doing so
        is proved by the simple fact that they regularly represented the
        Earth Goddess by a type which differed widely both from that of
        Demeter and from that of Persephone.<a id="noteref_303" name=

        only so, but they sometimes set the two types of the Earth Goddess
        and the Corn Goddess (Demeter) side by side as if on purpose to
        demonstrate their difference. Thus at Patrae there was a sanctuary of
        Demeter, in which she and Persephone were portrayed standing, while
        Earth was represented by a seated image;<a id="noteref_304" name=
        "noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> and on
        a vase-painting the Earth Goddess is seen appropriately emerging from
        the ground with a horn of plenty and an infant in her uplifted arms,
        while Demeter and Persephone, scarcely distinguishable from each
        other, stand at full height behind her, looking down at her
        half-buried figure, and Triptolemus in his wheeled car sits directly
        above her.<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href=
        "#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> In this
        instructive picture, accordingly, we see grouped together the
        principal personages in the myth of the corn: the Earth Goddess, the
        two Goddesses of the old and the new corn, and the hero who is said
        to have been sent forth by the Corn Goddess to sow the seed broadcast
        over the earth. Such representations seem to prove that the artists
        clearly distinguished Demeter from the Earth Goddess.<a id=

        090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not
        personify the earth, can there be any reasonable doubt that, like her
        daughter, she personified the corn which was so commonly called by
        her name from the time of Homer downwards? The essential identity of
        mother and daughter is suggested, not only by the close resemblance
        of their artistic types, but also by the official title of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Two Goddesses”</span> which was

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Surveying the
        evidence as a whole, we may say that from the myth of Demeter and
        Persephone, from their ritual, from their representations in art,
        from the titles which they bore, from the offerings of first-fruits
        which were presented to them, and from the names applied to the
        cereals, we are fairly entitled to conclude that in the mind of the
        ordinary Greek the two goddesses were essentially personifications of
        the corn, and that in this germ the whole efflorescence of their
        religion finds implicitly its explanation. But to maintain this is
        not to deny that in the long course of religious evolution high moral
        and spiritual conceptions were grafted on this simple original stock
        and blossomed out into fairer flowers than the bloom of the barley
        and the wheat. Above all, the thought of the seed buried in the earth
        in order to spring up to new and higher life readily suggested a
        comparison with human destiny, and strengthened the hope that for man
        too the grave may be but the beginning of a better and happier
        existence in some brighter world unknown. This simple and natural
        reflection seems perfectly sufficient to explain the association of
        the Corn Goddess at Eleusis with the mystery of death and the hope of
        a blissful immortality. For that the ancients regarded initiation in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091"
        id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Eleusinian mysteries as a
        key to unlock the gates of Paradise appears to be proved by the

        doubt it is easy for us to discern the flimsiness of the logical
        foundation on which such high hopes were built.<a id="noteref_310"

        drowning men clutch at straws, and we need not wonder that the
        Greeks, like ourselves, with death before them and a great love of
        life in their hearts, should not have stopped to weigh with too nice
        a hand the arguments that told for and against the prospect of human
        immortality. The reasoning that satisfied Saint Paul<a id=

        brought comfort to untold thousands of sorrowing Christians, standing
        by the deathbed or the open grave of their loved ones, was good
        enough to pass muster with ancient pagans, when they too bowed their
        heads under the burden of grief, and, with the taper of life burning
        low in the socket, looked forward into the darkness of the unknown.
        Therefore we do no indignity to the myth of Demeter and
        Persephone—one of the few myths in which the sunshine and clarity of
        the Greek genius are crossed by the shadow and mystery of death—when
        we trace its origin to some of the most familiar, yet eternally
        affecting aspects of nature, to the melancholy gloom and decay of

        association may seem to us, it is not without its analogy among the
        harvest customs of modern European peasantry.<a id="noteref_313"
        name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class=

        discover clear cases of games practised for the express purpose of
        promoting the growth of the crops, we must turn to more primitive
        agricultural communities than the Athenians of classical antiquity or
        the peoples of modern Europe. Such communities may be found at the
        present day among the savage tribes of Borneo and New Guinea, who
        subsist mainly by tilling the ground. Among them we take the Kayans
        or Bahaus of central Borneo as typical. They are essentially an
        agricultural people, and devote themselves mainly to the cultivation
        of rice, which furnishes their staple food; all other products of the
        ground are of subordinate importance. Hence agriculture, we are told,
        dominates the whole life of these tribes: their year is the year of
        the cultivation of the rice, and they divide it into various periods
        which are determined by the conditions necessary for the tilling of
        the fields and the manipulation <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the rice. <span class="tei tei-q">“In tribes
        whose thoughts are so much engrossed by agriculture it is no wonder
        that they associate with it their ideas of the powers which rule them
        for good or evil. The spirit-world stands in close connexion with the
        agriculture of the Bahaus; without the consent of the spirits no work
        in the fields may be undertaken. Moreover, all the great popular
        festivals coincide with the different periods of the cultivation of
        the rice. As the people are in an unusual state of affluence after
        harvest, all family festivals which require a large outlay are for
        practical reasons deferred till the New Year festival at the end of
        harvest. The two mighty spirits Amei Awi and his wife Buring Une,
        who, according to the belief of the Kayans, live in a world under
        ground, dominate the whole of the tillage and determine the issue of
        the harvest in great measure by the behaviour of the owner of the
        land, not so much by his moral conduct, as by the offerings he has
        made to the spirits and the attention he has paid to their warnings.
        An important part in agriculture falls to the chief: at the festivals
        he has, in the name of the whole tribe, to see to it that the
        prescribed conjurations are carried out by the priestesses. All
        religious ceremonies required for the cultivation of the ground take
        place in a small rice-field specially set apart for that purpose,
        called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">luma lali</span></span>: here the chief's family
        ushers in every fresh operation in the cultivation of the rice, such
        as sowing, hoeing, and reaping: the solemn actions there performed
        have a symbolical significance.”</span><a id="noteref_314" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not only the
        chief's family among the Kayans has such a consecrated field; every
        family possesses one of its own. These little fields are never
        cultivated for the sake of their produce: they serve only as the
        scene of religious ceremonies and of those symbolical operations of
        agriculture which are afterwards performed in earnest on the real
        rice-fields.<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href=
        "#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> For
        example, at the festival before sowing a priestess sows some rice on
        the consecrated field of the chief's family and then calls on a
        number of young men and girls to complete the work; the young men
        then dig holes in the ground with digging-sticks, and the girls come
        behind them and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg
        094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        plant the rice-seed in the holes. Afterwards the priestesses lay
        offerings of food, wrapt in banana-leaves, here and there on the holy
        field, while they croon prayers to the spirits in soft tones, which
        are half drowned in the clashing music of the gongs. On another day
        women gather all kinds of edible leaves in their gardens and fields,
        boil them in water, and then sprinkle the water on the consecrated
        rice-field. But on that and other days of the festival the people
        attend also to their own wants, banqueting on a favourite species of
        rice and other dainties. The ceremonies connected with sowing last
        several weeks, and during this time certain taboos have to be
        observed by the people. Thus on the first day of the festival the
        whole population, except the very old and the very young, must
        refrain from bathing; after that there follows a period of rest for
        eight nights, during which the people may neither work nor hold
        intercourse with their neighbours. On the tenth day the prohibition
        to bathe is again enforced; and during the eight following days the
        great rice-field of the village, where the real crops are raised, is
        sowed.<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href=
        "#note_316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> The
        reason for excluding strangers from the village at these times is a
        religious one. It is a fear lest the presence of strangers might
        frighten the spirits or put them in a bad humour, and so defeat the
        object of the ceremony; for, while the religious ceremonies which
        accompany the cultivation of the rice differ somewhat from each other
        in different tribes, the ideas at the bottom of them, we are told,
        are everywhere the same: the aim always is to appease and propitiate
        the souls of the rice and the other spirits by sacrifices of all
        sorts.<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, during
        this obligatory period of seclusion and rest the Kayans employ
        themselves in various pursuits, which, though at first sight they
        might seem to serve no other purpose than that of recreation, have
        really in the minds of the people a much deeper significance. For
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095"
        id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> example, at this time the men
        often play at spinning tops. The tops are smooth, flat pieces of wood
        weighing several pounds. Each man tries to spin his own top so that
        it knocks down those of his neighbours and continues itself to
        revolve triumphantly. New tops are commonly carved for the festival.
        The older men sometimes use heavy tops of iron-wood. Again, every
        evening the young men assemble in the open space before the chief's
        house and engage in contests of strength and agility, while the women
        watch them from the long gallery or verandah of the house. Another
        popular pastime during the festival of sowing is a masquerade. It
        takes place on the evening of the tenth day, the day on which, for
        the second time, the people are forbidden to bathe. The scene of the
        performance is again the open space in front of the chief's house. As
        the day draws towards evening, the villagers begin to assemble in the
        gallery or verandah of the house in order to secure good places for
        viewing the masquerade. All the maskers at these ceremonies represent
        evil spirits. The men wear ugly wooden masks on their faces, and
        their bodies are swathed in masses of slit banana leaves so as to
        imitate the hideous faces and hairy bodies of the demons. The young
        women wear on their heads cylindrical baskets, which conceal their
        real features, while they exhibit to the spectators grotesque human
        faces formed by stitches on pieces of white cotton, which are
        fastened to the baskets. On the occasion when Dr. Nieuwenhuis
        witnessed the ceremony, the first to appear on the scene were some
        men wearing wooden masks and helmets and so thickly wrapt in banana
        leaves that they looked like moving masses of green foliage. They
        danced silently, keeping time to the beat of the gongs. They were
        followed by other figures, some of whom executed war-dances; but the
        weight of their leafy envelope was such that they soon grew tired,
        and though they leaped high, they uttered none of the wild war-whoops
        which usually accompany these martial exercises. When darkness fell,
        the dances ceased and were replaced by a little drama representing a
        boar brought to bay by a pack of hounds. The part of the boar was
        played by an actor wearing a wooden boar's head mask, who ran about
        on all fours and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg
        096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        grunted in a life-like manner, while the hounds, acted by young men,
        snarled, yelped, and made dashes at him. The play was watched with
        lively interest and peals of laughter by the spectators. Later in the
        evening eight disguised girls danced, one behind the other, with slow
        steps and waving arms, to the glimmering light of torches and the
        strains of a sort of jew's harp.<a id="noteref_318" name=

        accompany the sowing of the fields are no sooner over than those
        which usher in the hoeing begin. Like the sowing ceremonies, they are
        inaugurated by a priestess, who hoes the sacred field round about a
        sacrificial stage and then calls upon other people to complete the
        work. After that the holy field is again sprinkled with a decoction

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the crowning
        point of the Kayan year is the New Year festival. The harvest has
        then been fully housed: abundance reigns in every family, and for
        eight days the people, dressed out in all their finery, give
        themselves up to mirth and jollity. The festival was witnessed by the
        Dutch explorer Dr. Nieuwenhuis. To lure the good spirits from the
        spirit land baskets filled with precious objects were set out before
        the windows, and the priestesses made long speeches, in which they
        invited these beneficent beings to come to the chief's house and to
        stay there during the whole of the ceremonies. Two days afterwards
        one of the priestesses harangued the spirits for three-quarters of an
        hour, telling them who the Kayans were, from whom the chief's family
        was descended, what the tribe was doing, and what were its wishes,
        not forgetting to implore the vengeance of the spirits on the
        Batang-Lupars, the hereditary foes of the Kayans. The harangue was
        couched in rhyming verse and delivered in sing-song tones. Five days
        later eight priestesses ascended a sacrificial stage, on which food
        was daily set forth for the spirits. There they joined hands and
        crooned another long address to the spirits, marking the time with
        their hands. Then a basket containing offerings of food was handed up
        to them, and one of the priestesses opened it and invited the spirits
        to enter the basket. When they were supposed to have done so, the lid
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097"
        id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was shut down on them, and the
        basket with the spirits in it was conveyed into the chief's house. As
        the priestesses in the performance of the sacred ceremonies might not
        touch the ground, planks were cut from a fruit-tree and laid on the
        ground for them to step on. But the great feature of the New Year
        festival is the sacrifice of pigs, of which the spiritual essence is
        appropriately offered to the spirits, while their material substance
        is consumed by the worshippers. In carrying out this highly
        satisfactory arrangement, while the live pigs lay tethered in a row
        on the ground, the priestesses danced solemnly round a sacrificial
        stage, each of them arrayed in a war-mantle of panther-skin and
        wearing a war-cap on her head, and on either side two priests armed
        with swords executed war dances for the purpose of scaring away evil
        spirits. By their gesticulations the priestesses indicated to the
        powers above that the pigs were intended for their benefit. One of
        them, a fat but dignified lady, dancing composedly, seemed by her
        courteous gestures to invite the souls of the pigs to ascend up to
        heaven; but others, not content with this too ideal offering, rushed
        at the pigs, seized the smallest of them by the hind legs, and
        exerting all their strength danced with the squealing porker to and
        from the sacrificial stage. In the evening, before darkness fell, the
        animals were slaughtered and their livers examined for omens: if the
        under side of the liver was pale, the omen was good; but if it was
        dark, the omen was evil. On the last day of the festival one of the
        chief priestesses, in martial array, danced round the sacrificial
        stage, making passes with her old sword as if she would heave the
        whole structure heavenward; while others stabbed with spears at the
        foul fiends that might be hovering in the air, intent on disturbing
        the sacred ministers at their holy work.<a id="noteref_320" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is the
        meaning of the sports and pastimes which custom prescribes to the
        Kayans on these occasions? Are they mere diversions meant to while
        away the tedium of the holidays? or have they a serious, perhaps a
        religious or magical significance? To this question it will be well
        to let Dr. Nieuwenhuis give his answer. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        Kayans on the Mendalam river,”</span> he says, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“enjoy tolerably regular harvests, and their agricultural
        festivals accordingly take place every year; whereas the Kayans on
        the Mahakam river, on account of the frequent failure of the
        harvests, can celebrate a New Year's festival only once in every two
        or three years. Yet although these festivities are celebrated more
        regularly on the Mendalam river, they are followed on the Mahakam
        river with livelier interest, and the meaning of all ceremonies and
        games can also be traced much better there. On the Mendalam river I
        came to the false conclusion that the popular games which take place
        at the festivals are undertaken quite arbitrarily at the seasons of
        sowing and harvest; but on the Mahakam river, on the contrary, I
        observed that even the masquerade at the sowing festival is invested
        with as deep a significance as any of the ceremonies performed by the
        priestesses.”</span><a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The influence of religious worship, which dominates the
        whole life of the Dyak tribes, manifests itself also in their games.
        This holds good chiefly of pastimes in which all adults take part
        together, mostly on definite occasions; it is less applicable to more
        individual pastimes which are not restricted to any special season.
        Pastimes of the former sort are very rarely indulged in at ordinary
        times, and properly speaking they attain their full significance only
        on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name=

        agricultural festivals which bear a strictly religious stamp. Even
        then the recreations are not left to choice, but definite games
        belong to definite festivals; thus at the sowing festivals other
        amusements are in vogue than at the little harvest festival or the
        great harvest festival at the beginning of the reaping, and at the
        New Year festival.... Is this connexion between festivals and games
        merely an accidental one, or is it based on a real affinity? The
        latter seems to me the more probable view, for in the case of one of
        the most important games played by men I was able to prove directly a
        religious significance; and although I failed to do so in the case of
        the others, I conjecture, nevertheless, that a religious idea lies at
        the bottom of all other games which are connected with definite

        similar games which another primitive agricultural people avowedly
        play for the purpose of ensuring good crops. The people in question
        are the Kai of German New Guinea, who inhabit the rugged, densely
        wooded mountains inland from Finsch Harbour. They subsist mainly on
        the produce of the taro and yams which they cultivate in their
        fields, though the more inland people also make much use of sweet
        potatoes. All their crops are root crops. No patch of ground is
        cultivated for more than a year at a time. As soon as it has yielded
        a crop, it is deserted for another and is quickly overgrown with rank
        weeds, bamboos, and bushes. In six or eight years, when the
        undergrowth has died out under the shadow of the taller trees which
        have shot up, the land may again be cleared and brought under
        cultivation. Thus the area of cultivation shifts from year to year;
        and the villages are not much more permanent; for in the damp
        tropical climate the wooden houses soon rot and fall into
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100"
        id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ruins, and when this happens
        the site of the village is changed.<a id="noteref_324" name=
        "noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a> To
        procure good crops of the taro and yams, on which they depend for
        their subsistence, the Kai resort to many superstitious practices.
        For example, in order to make the yams strike deep roots, they touch
        the shoots with the bone of a wild animal that has been killed in the
        recesses of a cave, imagining that just as the creature penetrated
        deep into the earth, so the shoots that have been touched with its
        bone will descend deep into the ground. And in order that the taro
        may bear large and heavy fruit, they place the shoots, before
        planting them, on a large and heavy block of stone, believing that
        the stone will communicate its valuable properties of size and weight
        to the future fruit. Moreover, great use is made of spells and
        incantations to promote the growth of the crops, and all persons who
        utter such magical formulas for this purpose have to abstain from
        eating certain foods until the plants have sprouted and give promise
        of a good crop. For example, they may not eat young bamboo shoots,
        which are a favourite article of diet with the people. The reason is
        that the young shoots are covered with fine prickles, which cause
        itching and irritation of the skin; from which the Kai infer that if
        an enchanter of field fruits were to eat bamboo shoots, the contagion
        of their prickles would be conveyed through him to the fruits and
        would manifest itself in a pungent disagreeable flavour. For a
        similar reason no charmer of the crops who knows his business would
        dream of eating crabs, because he is well aware that if he were to do
        so the leaves and stalks of the plants would be dashed in pieces by a
        pelting rain, just like the long thin brittle legs of a dead crab.
        Again, were such an enchanter to eat any of the edible kinds of
        locusts, it seems obvious to the Kai that locusts would devour the
        crops over which the imprudent wizard had recited his spells. Above
        all, people who are concerned in planting fields must on no account
        eat pork; because pigs, whether wild or tame, are the most deadly
        enemies of the crops, which they grub up and destroy; from which it
        follows, as surely as the night does the day, that if you eat pork
        while <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name=
        "Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> you are at work on the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, these
        precautions are not the only measures which the Kai people adopt for
        the benefit of the yams and the taro. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the
        opinion of the natives various games are important for a proper
        growth of the field-fruits; hence these games may only be played in
        the time after the work on the fields has been done. Thus to swing on
        a long Spanish reed fastened to a branch of a tree is thought to have
        a good effect on the newly planted yams. Therefore swinging is
        practised by old and young, by men and women. No one who has an
        interest in the growth of his crop in the field leaves the swing
        idle. As they swing to and fro they sing swing-songs. These songs
        often contain only the names of the kinds of yams that have been
        planted, together with the joyous harvest-cry repeated with
        variations, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have found a fine
        fruit!’</span> In leaping from the swing, they cry <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Kakulili</span></span>!’</span> By calling out
        the name of the yams they think to draw their shoots upwards out of
        the ground. A small bow with a string, on which a wooden flag adorned
        with a feather is made to slide down (the Kai call the instrument
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tawatawa</span></span>), may only be used when
        the yams are beginning to wind up about their props. The tender
        shoots are then touched with the bow, while a song is sung which is
        afterwards often repeated in the village. It runs thus: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mama gelo, gelowaineja, gelowaineja; kikí
        tambai, kíki tambai.</span></span>’</span> The meaning of the words
        is unknown. The intention is to cause a strong upward growth of the
        plants. In order that the foliage of the yams may sprout luxuriantly
        and grow green and spread, the Kai people play cat's cradle. Each of
        the intricate figures has a definite meaning and a name to match: for
        example <span class="tei tei-q">‘the flock of pigeons’</span>
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hulua</span></span>), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘the Star,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Flying

        "tei tei-q">‘the Lizard and the Dog,’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘the Pig,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
        Sentinel-box in the Fields,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
        Rat's Nest,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Wasp's Nest in the
        Bamboo-thicket,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
        Kangaroo,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Spider's Web,’</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Little Children,’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘the Canoe,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Rain and

        Grave,’</span> etc. By spinning large native acorns or a sort of wild
        fig they think that they foster the growth of the newly-planted taro;
        the plants will <span class="tei tei-q">‘turn about and
        broaden.’</span> The game must therefore only be played at the time
        when the taro is planted. The same holds good of spearing at the
        stalks of taro leaves with the ribs of sago leaves used as miniature
        spears. This is done when the taro leaves have unfolded themselves,
        but when the plants have not yet set any tubers. A single leaf is cut
        from a number of stems, and these leaves are brought into the
        village. The game is played by two partners, who sit down opposite to
        each other at a distance of three or four paces. A number of taro
        stalks lie beside each. He who has speared all his adversary's stalks
        first is victor; then they change stalks and the game begins again.
        By piercing the leaves they think that they incite the plants to set
        tubers. Almost more remarkable than the limitation of these games to
        the time when work on the fields is going forward is the custom of
        the Kai people which only permits the tales of the olden time or
        popular legends to be told at the time when the newly planted fruits
        are budding and sprouting.”</span><a id="noteref_326" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> At the
        end of every such tale the Kai story-teller mentions the names of the
        various kinds of yams and adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shoots (for
        the new planting) and fruits (to eat) in abundance!”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“From their concluding words we see that the
        Kai legends are only told for a quite definite purpose, namely, to
        promote the welfare of the yams planted in the field. By reviving the
        memory of the ancient beings, to whom the origin of the field-fruits
        is referred, they imagine that they influence the growth of the
        fruits for good. When the planting is over, and especially when the
        young plants begin to sprout, the telling of legends comes to an end.
        In the villages it is always only a few old men who as good
        story-tellers can hold the attention of their hearers.”</span><a id=

        based on the principles of sympathetic magic. In playing the

        id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> games the players perform acts
        which are supposed to mimic or at all events to stimulate the
        corresponding processes in the plants: by swinging high in the air
        they make the plants grow high; by playing cat's cradle they cause
        the leaves of the yams to spread and the stalks to intertwine, even
        as the players spread their hands and twine the string about their
        fingers; by spinning fruits they make the taro plants to turn and

        telling the legends the story-tellers mention the names of the
        powerful beings who first created the fruits of the earth, and the
        mere mention of their names avails, on the principle of the magical
        equivalence of names and persons or things, to reproduce the

        recitation of tales as a charm to promote the growth of the crops is
        not peculiar to the Kai. It is practised also by the Bakaua, another
        tribe of German New Guinea, who inhabit the coast of Huon Gulf, not
        far from the Kai. These people tell stories in the evening at the
        time when the yams and taro are ripe, and the stories always end with
        a prayer to the ancestral spirits, invoked under various more or less
        figurative designations, such as <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        man”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“a cricket,”</span> that they
        would be pleased to cause countless shoots to sprout, the great
        tubers to swell, the sugar-cane to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        clusters. <span class="tei tei-q">“From this we see,”</span> says the
        missionary who reports the custom, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the
        object of telling the stories is to prove to the ancestors, whose
        spirits are believed to be present at the recitation of the tales
        which they either invented or inherited, that people always remember
        them; for which reason they ought to be favourable to their
        descendants, and above all to bestow their blessings on the shoots
        which are ready to be planted or on the plants already in the
        ground.”</span> As the story-teller utters the prayer, he looks
        towards the house in which the young shoots ready for planting or the
        ripe fruits are deposited.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330"

        at the same time they minister to the grosser appetites of the

        prayers which they address to the spirits of the dead for the sake of
        procuring an abundant harvest, the Yabim utter spells for the same
        purpose, and these spells sometimes take the form, not of a command,
        but of a narrative. Here, for instance, is one of their spells:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Once upon a time a man laboured in his field
        and complained that he had no <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> taro shoots. Then came two doves flying from
        Poum. They had devoured much taro, and they perched on a tree in the
        field, and during the night they vomited all the taro up. Thus the
        man got so many taro shoots that he was even able to sell some of
        them to other people.”</span> Or, again, if the taro will not bud,
        the Yabim will have recourse to the following spell: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A muraena lay at ebb-tide on the shore. It seemed to be
        at its last gasp. Then the tide flowed on, and the muraena came to
        life again and plunged into the deep water.”</span> This spell is
        pronounced over twigs of a certain tree (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kalelong</span></span>), while the enchanter
        smites the ground with them. After that the taro is sure to
        bud.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a>
        Apparently the mere recitation of such simple tales is thought to
        produce the same effect as a direct appeal, whether in the shape of a
        prayer or a command, addressed to the spirits. Such incantations may
        be called narrative spells to distinguish them from the more familiar
        imperative spells, in which the enchanter expresses his wishes in the
        form of direct commands. Much use seems to be made of such narrative
        spells among the natives of this part of German New Guinea. For
        example, among the Bukaua, who attribute practically boundless powers
        to sorcerers in every department of life and nature, the spells by
        which these wizards attempt to work their will assume one of two
        forms: either they are requests made to the ancestors, or they are
        short narratives, addressed to nobody in particular, which the
        sorcerer mutters while he is performing his magical rites.<a id=
        "noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> It is
        true, that here the distinction is drawn between narratives and
        requests rather than between narratives and commands; but the
        difference of a request from a command, though great in theory, may
        be very slight in practice; so that prayer and spell, in the ordinary
        sense of the words, may melt into each other almost imperceptibly.
        Even the priest or the enchanter who utters the one may be hardly
        conscious of the hairbreadth that divides it from the other. In
        regard to narrative spells, it seems probable that they have been
        used much more extensively among mankind than the evidence at our
        disposal permits <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg
        106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> us
        positively to affirm; in particular we may conjecture that many
        ancient narratives, which we have been accustomed to treat as mere
        myths, used to be regularly recited in magical rites as spells for
        the purpose of actually producing events like those which they
        describe.</p>

        bull-roarer to quicken the fruits of the earth is not peculiar to the
        Yabim. On the other side of New Guinea the instrument is employed for
        the same purpose by the natives of Kiwai, an island at the mouth of
        the Fly River. They think that by whirling bull-roarers they produce
        good crops of yams, sweet potatoes, and bananas; and in accordance
        with this belief they call the implement <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        mother of yams.”</span><a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href=

        Similarly in Mabuiag, an island in Torres Straits, the bull-roarer is
        looked upon as an instrument that can be used to promote the growth
        of garden produce, such as yams and sweet potatoes; certain spirits
        were supposed to march round the gardens at night swinging
        bull-roarers for this purpose.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337"

        a fertilising or prolific virtue appears to be attributed to the
        instrument by savages who are totally ignorant of agriculture. Thus
        among the Dieri of central Australia, when a young man had undergone
        the painful initiatory ceremony of having a number of gashes cut in
        his back, he used to be given a bull-roarer, whereupon it was
        believed that he became inspired by the spirits of the men of old,
        and that by whirling it, when he went in search of game before his
        wounds were healed, he had power to cause a good harvest of lizards,
        snakes, and other reptiles. On the other hand, the Dieri thought that
        if a woman were to see a bull-roarer that had been used at the
        initiatory ceremonies and to learn its secret, the tribe would ever
        afterwards be destitute of snakes, lizards, and other such
        food.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href=

        power to fertilise or multiply edible plants and animals has been
        ascribed to the bull-roarer by many other peoples who employ the
        implement in their mysteries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, it is to
        be observed that just as the Kai of New Guinea swing to and fro on
        reeds suspended from the branches of trees in order to promote the

        their leisure to swinging in spring and early summer for the express

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains to
        point out how far the religious or magical practices of these
        primitive agricultural peoples of Borneo and New Guinea appear to
        illustrate by analogy the original nature of the rites of Eleusis. So
        far as we can recompose, from the broken fragments of tradition, a
        picture of the religious and political condition of the Eleusinian
        people in the olden time, it appears to tally fairly well with the
        picture which Dr. Nieuwenhuis has drawn for us of the Kayans or
        Bahaus at the present day in the forests of central Borneo. Here as
        there we see a petty agricultural community ruled by hereditary

        the crops, on which they depend for their subsistence, is at the
        mercy of two powerful spirits, a divine husband and his wife,
        dwelling in a subterranean world; and who accordingly offer
        sacrifices and perform ceremonies in order to ensure the favour of
        these mighty beings and so to obtain abundant harvests. If we knew
        more about the Rarian plain at Eleusis,<a id="noteref_343" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a> we
        might discover that it was the scene of many religious ceremonies
        like those which are performed on the little consecrated rice-fields
        (the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">luma lali</span></span>) of the Kayans, where
        the various operations of the agricultural year are performed in
        miniature by members of the chief's family before the corresponding
        operations may be performed on a larger scale by common folk on their
        fields. Certainly we know that the Rarian plain witnessed one such
        ceremony in the year. It was a solemn ceremony of ploughing, one of
        the three Sacred Ploughings which took place annually in various
        parts of Attica.<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href=

        Probably the rite formed part of the <span lang="el" class=

        Further, it appears that the priests who guided the sacred slow-paced
        oxen as they dragged the plough down the furrows of the Rarian Plain,
        were drawn from the old priestly family of Bouzygai or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ox-yokers,”</span> whose eponymous ancestor is said to
        have been the first man to yoke oxen and to plough the fields. As
        they performed this time-honoured ceremony, the priests uttered many
        quaint curses against all churls who should refuse to lend fire or
        water to neighbours, or to shew the way to wanderers, or who should

        the Sabbath, as we may call those periods of enforced rest and

        when we find the same simple instrument whirled by savages in New
        Guinea for the sake of ensuring good crops, we may reasonably
        conjecture that it was whirled with a like intention by the rude
        forefathers of the Greeks among the cornfields of Eleusis. If that
        were so—though the conjecture is hardly susceptible of
        demonstration—it would go some way to confirm the theory that the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111"
        id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Eleusinian mysteries were in
        their origin nothing more than simple rustic ceremonies designed to
        make the farmer's fields to wave with yellow corn. And in the
        practice of the Kayans, whose worship of the rice offers many
        analogies to the Eleusinian worship of the corn, may we not detect a
        hint of the origin of that rule of secrecy which always characterised
        the Eleusinian mysteries? May it not have been that, just as the
        Kayans exclude strangers from their villages while they are engaged
        in the celebration of religious rites, lest the presence of these
        intruders should frighten or annoy the shy and touchy spirits who are
        invoked at these times, so the old Eleusinians may have debarred
        foreigners from participation in their most solemn ceremonies, lest
        the coy goddesses of the corn should take fright or offence at the
        sight of strange faces and so refuse to bestow on men their annual
        blessing? The admission of foreigners to the privilege of initiation
        in the mysteries was probably a late innovation introduced at a time
        when the fame of their sanctity had spread far and wide, and when the
        old magical meaning of the ritual had long been obscured, if not
        forgotten.</p>

        interpretation of that solemn drama is correct, it represented in
        mythical guise the various stages in the growth of the corn for the
        purpose of magically fostering the natural processes which it
        simulated. In like manner among the Kaua and Kobeua Indians of
        North-western Brazil, who subsist chiefly by the cultivation of
        manioc, dances or rather pantomimes are performed by masked men, who
        represent spirits or demons of fertility, and by imitating the act of
        procreation are believed to stimulate the growth of plants as well as
        to quicken the wombs of women and to promote the multiplication of

        male power? They conceived the spirit of the vine as masculine; why
        did they conceive the spirit of the barley and wheat as feminine? To
        this it has been answered that the personification of the corn as
        feminine, or at all events the ascription of the discovery of
        agriculture to a goddess, was suggested by the prominent part which

        personifications of nature. For that reason, apart from its intrinsic
        interest, the theory deserves to be briefly considered.</p>

        invention of the plough, which can hardly be worked without resort to
        the labour of men, it was and still is customary in many parts of the
        world to break up the soil for cultivation with hoes, and among not a
        few savage peoples to this day the task of hoeing the ground and
        sowing the seed devolves mainly or entirely upon the women, while the
        men take little or no part in cultivation beyond clearing the land by
        felling the forest trees and burning the fallen timber and brushwood
        which encumber the soil. Thus, for example, among the Zulus,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“when a piece of land has been selected for
        cultivation, the task of clearing it <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> belongs to the men. If the ground be much
        encumbered, this becomes a laborious undertaking, for their axe is
        very small, and when a large tree has to be encountered, they can
        only lop the branches; fire is employed when it is needful to remove
        the trunk. The reader will therefore not be surprised that the people
        usually avoid bush-land, though they seem to be aware of its superior
        fertility. As a general rule the men take no further share in the
        labour of cultivation; and, as the site chosen is seldom much
        encumbered and frequently bears nothing but grass, their part of the
        work is very slight. The women are the real labourers; for (except in
        some particular cases) the entire business of digging, planting, and
        weeding devolves on them; and, if we regard the assagai and shield as
        symbolical of the man, the hoe may be looked upon as emblematic of
        the woman.... With this rude and heavy instrument the woman digs,

        product. Most fields are allowed to lie fallow every fourth or fifth

        initial clearing of the land it was customary for the husband to take

        least, the respective condition of the two sexes among almost all the
        Americans. The Peruvians alone had already, in their semi-civilised
        state, partially modified these customs; for among them the man
        shared the toils of the other sex or took on himself the most
        laborious tasks.”</span><a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href=

        to take examples, among the Caribs of the West Indies the men used to
        fell the trees and leave the fallen trunks to cumber the ground,
        burning off only the smaller boughs. Then the women came and planted
        manioc, potatoes, yams, and bananas wherever they found room among
        the tree-trunks. In digging the ground to receive the seed or the
        shoots they did not use hoes but simply pointed sticks. The men, we
        are told, would rather have died of hunger than undertake such
        agricultural labours.<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href=

        the staple vegetable food of the Indians of British Guiana is cassava
        bread, made from the roots of the manioc or cassava plant, which the
        Indians cultivate in clearings of the forest. The men fell the trees,
        cut down the undergrowth, and in dry weather set fire to the fallen
        lumber, thus creating open patches in the forest which are covered
        with white ashes. When the rains <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> set in, the women repair to these clearings,
        heavily laden with baskets full of cassava sticks to be used as
        cuttings. These they insert at irregular intervals in the soil, and
        so the field is formed. While the cassava is growing, the women do
        just as much weeding as is necessary to prevent the cultivated plants
        from being choked by the rank growth of the tropical vegetation, and
        in doing so they plant bananas, pumpkin seeds, yams, sweet potatoes,
        sugar-cane, red and yellow peppers, and so forth, wherever there is
        room for them. At last in the ninth or tenth month, when the seeds
        appearing on the straggling branches of the cassava plants announce
        that the roots are ripe, the women cut down the plants and dig up the
        roots, not all at once, but as they are required. These roots they
        afterwards peel, scrape, and bake into cassava bread.<a id=

        pointed sticks, and the women following them, putting the seeds or
        shoots into the holes, and then huddling the earth over them; for
        savages seldom sow broadcast, they laboriously dig holes and insert
        the seed in them. This division of agricultural labour between the
        sexes is adopted by various tribes of Celebes, Ceram, Borneo, Nias,

        Sometimes the custom of entrusting the sowing of the seed to women
        appears to be influenced by superstitious as well as economic
        considerations. Thus among the Indians of the Orinoco, who with an
        infinitude of pains cleared the jungle for cultivation by cutting
        down the forest trees with their stone axes, burning the fallen
        lumber, and breaking up the ground with wooden instruments hardened
        in the fire, the task of sowing the maize and planting the roots was
        performed by the women alone; and when the Spanish missionaries
        expostulated with the men for not helping their wives in this
        toilsome duty, they received for answer that as women knew how to
        conceive seed and bear children, so the seeds and roots planted by
        them bore fruit far more abundantly than if they had been planted by
        male hands.<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href=

        these rude savages possessed a calendar containing directions as to
        the seasons for collecting the different seeds and produce of the
        earth. The calendar consisted of lunar months corrected by
        observation of the solstices, <span class="tei tei-q">“for at the

        observed with greater attention and celebrated with more pomp, the
        sun's arrival at the tropic of Capricorn than they did his reaching
        the tropic of Cancer, for the reason, that, as they were situated ten
        degrees from the latter, they were pleased at the sun's approach
        towards them; for it returned to ripen their fruits and seeds, to
        give warmth to the atmosphere, and enliven again the fields with
        beauty and increase.”</span> However, the knowledge of the calendar

        loosen the earth, which is scooped up and thrown out with the fingers
        of the left hand, and in this manner they dig with great rapidity.
        But the labour, in proportion to the amount obtained, is great. To
        get a yam about half an inch in circumference and a foot in length,
        they have to dig a hole above a foot square and two feet in depth; a

        fertile districts, where the yams which the aborigines use as food
        grow abundantly, the ground may sometimes be seen riddled with holes
        made by the women in their search for these edible roots. Thus to
        quote Sir George Grey: <span class="tei tei-q">“We now crossed the
        dry bed of a stream, and from that emerged upon a tract of light
        fertile soil, quite overrun with <span class=

        which is a favourite article of food with the natives. This was the
        first time we had yet seen this plant on our journey, and now for
        three and a half consecutive miles we traversed a fertile piece of
        land, literally perforated with the holes the natives had made to dig
        this root; indeed we could with difficulty walk across it on that
        account, whilst this tract extended east and west as far as we could

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these customs
        observed by savages who are totally ignorant of agriculture we may
        perhaps detect some of the steps by which mankind have advanced from
        the enjoyment of the wild fruits of the earth to the systematic
        cultivation of plants. For an effect of digging up the earth in the
        search for roots has probably been in many cases to enrich and
        fertilise the soil and so to increase the crop of roots or herbs; and
        such an increase would naturally attract the natives in larger
        numbers and enable them to subsist for longer periods on the spot
        without being compelled by the speedy exhaustion of the crop to shift
        their quarters and wander away in search of fresh supplies. Moreover,
        the winnowing of the seeds on ground which had thus been turned up by
        the digging-sticks of the women would naturally contribute to the
        same result. For though savages at the level of the Californian
        Indians and the aborigines of Australia have no idea of using seeds
        for any purpose but that of immediate consumption, and it has never
        occurred to them to incur a temporary loss for the sake of a future
        gain by sowing them in the ground, yet it is almost certain that in
        the process of winnowing the seeds as a preparation for eating them
        many of the grains must have escaped and, being wafted by the wind,
        have fallen on the upturned soil and borne fruit. Thus by the
        operations of turning up the ground and winnowing the seed, though
        neither operation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg
        129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        aimed at anything beyond satisfying the immediate pangs of hunger,
        savage man or rather savage woman was unconsciously preparing for the
        whole community a future and more abundant store of food, which would
        enable them to multiply and to abandon the old migratory and wasteful
        manner of life for a more settled and economic mode of existence. So
        curiously sometimes does man, aiming his shafts at a near but petty
        mark, hit a greater and more distant target.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole,
        then, it appears highly probable that as a consequence of a certain
        natural division of labour between the sexes women have contributed

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Aryan

        the labour of ploughing practically necessitates the employment of
        masculine strength, it is hardly to be expected that in Europe many
        traces should remain of the important part formerly played by women
        in primitive agriculture. However, we are told that among the
        Iberians of Spain and the Athamanes of Epirus the women tilled the
        ground,<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href=
        "#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> and
        that among the ancient Germans the care of the fields was left to the
        women and old men.<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href=
        "#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        these indications of an age when the cultivation of the ground was
        committed mainly to feminine hands are few and slight; and if the
        Greek conception of Demeter as a goddess of corn and agriculture
        really dates from such an age and was directly suggested by such a
        division of labour between the sexes, it <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> seems clear that its origin must be sought at a
        period far back in the history of the Aryan race, perhaps long before
        the segregation of the Greeks from the common stock and their
        formation into a separate people. It may be so, but to me I confess
        that this derivation of the conception appears somewhat far-fetched
        and improbable; and I prefer to suppose that the idea of the corn as
        feminine was suggested to the Greek mind, not by the position of
        women in remote prehistoric ages, but by a direct observation of
        nature, the teeming head of corn appearing to the primitive fancy to
        resemble the teeming womb of a woman, and the ripe ear on the stalk
        being likened to a child borne in the arms or on the back of its
        mother. At least we know that similar sights suggest similar ideas to
        some of the agricultural negroes of West Africa. Thus the Hos of
        Togoland, who plant maize in February and reap it in July, say that
        the maize is an image of a mother; when the cobs are forming, the
        mother is binding the infant on her back, but in July she sinks her
        head and dies and the child is taken away from her, to be afterwards
        multiplied at the next sowing.<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415"
        href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> When
        the rude aborigines of Western Australia observe that a seed-bearing
        plant has flowered, they call it the Mother of So-and-so, naming the
        particular kind of plant, and they will not allow it to be dug
        up.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href=

        Apparently they think that respect and regard are due to the plant as
        to a mother and her child. Such simple and natural comparisons, which
        may occur to men in any age and country, suffice to explain the Greek
        personification of the corn as mother and daughter, and we need not
        cast about for more recondite theories. Be that as it may, the
        conception of the corn as a woman and a mother was certainly not
        peculiar to the ancient Greeks, but has been shared by them with many
        other races, as will appear abundantly from the instances which I
        shall cite in the following chapter.</p>

        is safer therefore to lay no stress on it. Be that as it may, we have
        found independent reasons for identifying Demeter as the Corn-mother,
        and of the two species of corn associated with her in Greek

        wheat, the barley has perhaps the better claim to be her original
        element; for not only would it seem to have been the staple food of
        the Greeks in the Homeric age, but there are grounds for believing
        that it is one of the oldest, if not the very oldest, cereal
        cultivated by the Aryan race. Certainly the use of barley in the
        religious ritual of the ancient Hindoos as well as of the ancient
        Greeks furnishes a strong argument in favour of the great antiquity
        of its cultivation, which is known to have been practised by the

        believed to be present in the handful of corn which is left standing
        last on the field; and with the cutting of this last handful she is
        caught, or driven away, or killed. In the first of these cases, the
        last sheaf is carried joyfully home and honoured as a divine being.
        It is placed in the barn, and at threshing the corn-spirit appears
        again.<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href=

        Hanoverian district of Hadeln the reapers stand round the last sheaf
        and beat it with sticks in order to drive the Corn-mother out of it.
        They call to each other, <span class="tei tei-q">“There she is! hit
        her! Take care she doesn't catch you!”</span> The beating goes on
        till the grain is completely threshed out; then the Corn-mother is
        believed to be driven away.<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430"

        neighbourhood of Danzig the person who cuts the last ears of corn
        makes them into a doll, which is called the Corn-mother or the Old

        "Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Holstein the last
        sheaf is dressed in woman's clothes and called the Corn-mother. It is
        carried home on the last waggon, and then thoroughly drenched with
        water. The drenching with water is doubtless a rain-charm.<a id=

        district of Bruck in Styria the last sheaf, called the Corn-mother,
        is made up into the shape of a woman by the oldest married woman in
        the village, of an age from fifty to fifty-five years. The finest
        ears are plucked out of it and made into a wreath, which, twined with
        flowers, is carried on her head by the prettiest girl of the village
        to the farmer or squire, while the Corn-mother is laid down in the
        barn to keep off the mice.<a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433"
        href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        other villages of the same district the Corn-mother, at the close of
        harvest, is carried by two lads at the top of a pole. They march
        behind the girl who wears the wreath to the squire's house, and while
        he receives the wreath and hangs it up in the hall, the Corn-mother
        is placed on the top of a pile of wood, where she is the centre of
        the harvest supper and dance. Afterwards she is hung up in the barn
        and remains there till the threshing is over. The man who gives the
        last stroke at threshing is called the son of the Corn-mother; he is
        tied up in the Corn-mother, beaten, and carried through the village.
        The wreath is dedicated in church on the following Sunday; and on
        Easter Eve the grain is rubbed out of it by a seven-years-old girl
        and scattered amongst the young corn. At Christmas the straw of the
        wreath is placed in the manger to make the cattle thrive.<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a> Here
        the fertilising power of the Corn-mother is plainly brought out by
        scattering the seed taken from her body (for the wreath is made out
        of the Corn-mother) among the new corn; and her influence over animal
        life is indicated by placing the straw in the manger. At Westerhüsen,
        in Saxony, the last corn cut is made in the shape of a woman decked
        with ribbons and cloth. It is fastened to a pole and brought home on
        the last waggon. One of the people in the waggon keeps waving the
        pole, so that the figure moves as if alive. It is placed on the
        threshing-floor, and stays there till the threshing is done.<a id=

        last sheaf is known as the Rye-mother, the Wheat-mother, the
        Oats-mother, the Barley-mother, and so on, according to the crop. In
        the district of Tarnow, Galicia, the wreath made out of the last
        stalks is called the Wheat-mother, Rye-mother, or Pea-mother. It is
        placed on a girl's head and kept till spring, when some of the grain
        is mixed with the seed-corn.<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436"

        again the fertilising power of the Corn-mother is indicated. In
        France, also, in the neighbourhood of Auxerre, the last sheaf goes by
        the name of the Mother of the Wheat, Mother of the Barley, Mother of
        the Rye, or Mother of the Oats. They leave it standing in the field
        till the last waggon is about to wend homewards. Then they make a
        puppet out of it, dress it with clothes belonging to the farmer, and
        adorn it with a crown and a blue or white scarf. A branch of a tree
        is stuck in the breast of the puppet, which is now called the Ceres.
        At the dance in the evening the Ceres is set in the middle of the
        floor, and the reaper who reaped fastest dances round it with the
        prettiest girl for his partner. After the dance a pyre is made. All
        the girls, each wearing a wreath, strip the puppet, pull it to
        pieces, and place it on the pyre, along with the flowers with which
        it was adorned. Then the girl who was the first to finish reaping
        sets fire to the pile, and all pray that Ceres may give a fruitful
        year. Here, as Mannhardt observes, the old custom has remained
        intact, though the name Ceres is a bit of schoolmaster's
        learning.<a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href=

        Upper Brittany the last sheaf is always made into human shape; but if
        the farmer is a married man, it is made double and consists of a
        little corn-puppet placed inside of a large one. This is called the
        Mother-sheaf. It is delivered to the farmer's wife, who unties it and
        gives drink-money in return.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the last
        sheaf is called, not the Corn-mother, but the Harvest-mother or the
        Great Mother. In the province of Osnabrück, Hanover, it is called the
        Harvest-mother; it is made up in female form, and then the reapers
        dance about with it. In some parts of Westphalia the last sheaf at
        the rye-harvest is made especially heavy by fastening <span class=

        last waggon and call it the Great Mother, though they do not fashion
        it into any special shape. In the district of Erfurt a very heavy
        sheaf, not necessarily the last, is called the Great Mother, and is
        carried on the last waggon to the barn, where all hands lift it down
        amid a fire of jokes.<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href=

        the last sheaf is called the Grandmother, and is adorned with
        flowers, ribbons, and a woman's apron. In East Prussia, at the rye or
        wheat harvest, the reapers call out to the woman who binds the last
        sheaf, <span class="tei tei-q">“You are getting the Old
        Grandmother.”</span> In the neighbourhood of Magdeburg the men and
        women servants strive who shall get the last sheaf, called the
        Grandmother. Whoever gets it will be married in the next year, but
        his or her spouse will be old; if a girl gets it, she will marry a
        widower; if a man gets it, he will marry an old crone. In Silesia the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some of these
        customs, as Mannhardt has remarked, the person who is called by the
        same name as the last sheaf and sits beside it on the last waggon is
        obviously identified <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg
        139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        with it; he or she represents the corn-spirit which has been caught
        in the last sheaf; in other words, the corn-spirit is represented in
        duplicate, by a human being and by a sheaf.<a id="noteref_457" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a> The
        identification of the person with the sheaf is made still clearer by
        the custom of wrapping up in the last sheaf the person who cuts or
        binds it. Thus at Hermsdorf in Silesia it used to be the regular
        practice to tie up in the last sheaf the woman who had bound
        it.<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href=

        Weiden, in Bavaria, it is the cutter, not the binder, of the last
        sheaf who is tied up in it.<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459"

        the person wrapt up in the corn represents the corn-spirit, exactly
        as a person wrapt in branches or leaves represents the
        tree-spirit.<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last sheaf,
        designated as the Old Woman, is often distinguished from the other
        sheaves by its size and weight. Thus in some villages of West Prussia
        the Old Woman is made twice as long and thick as a common sheaf, and
        a stone is fastened in the middle of it. Sometimes it is made so
        heavy that a man can barely lift it.<a id="noteref_461" name=

        Alt-Pillau, in Samland, eight or nine sheaves are often tied together
        to make the Old Woman, and the man who sets it up grumbles at its
        weight.<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href=

        Itzgrund, in Saxe-Coburg, the last sheaf, called the Old Woman, is
        made large with the express intention of thereby securing a good crop
        next year.<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href=

        the custom of making the last sheaf unusually large or heavy is a
        charm, working by sympathetic magic, to ensure a large and heavy crop
        at the following harvest. In Denmark also the last sheaf is made
        larger than the others, and is called the Old Rye-woman or the Old
        Barley-woman. No one likes to bind it, because whoever does so will
        be sure, they think, to marry an old man or an old woman. Sometimes
        the last wheat-sheaf, called the Old Wheat-woman, is made up in human
        shape, with head, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg

        general account of the custom is given by a careful and well-informed

        island of Tiree: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Harvest Old Wife
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">a

        when tillage in common existed, instances were known of a ridge being
        left unshorn (no person would claim it) because of it being behind
        the rest. The fear entertained was that of having the <span class=

        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">gort a

        harvest. Much emulation and amusement arose from the fear of this old
        woman.... The first done made a doll of some blades of corn, which
        was called the <span class="tei tei-q">‘old wife,’</span> and sent it
        to his nearest neighbour. He in turn, when ready, passed it to
        another still less expeditious, and the person it last remained with

        farm, or croft. Where there are a number of crofts beside each other,
        there is always great rivalry as to who shall first finish reaping,
        and so have the Old Wife before his neighbours. Some people even go
        out on a clear night to reap their fields after their neighbours have
        retired to rest, in order that they may have the Old Wife first. More
        neighbourly habits, however, usually prevail, and as each finishes
        his own fields he goes to the help of another, till the whole crop is
        cut. The reaping is still done with the sickle. When the corn has
        been cut on all the crofts, the last sheaf is dressed up to look as
        like an old woman as possible. She wears a white cap, a dress, an
        apron, and a little shawl over the shoulders fastened with a sprig of
        heather. The apron is tucked up to form a pocket, which is stuffed
        with bread and cheese. A sickle, stuck in the string of the apron at
        the back, completes her equipment. This costume and outfit mean that
        the Old Wife is ready to bear a hand in the work of harvesting. At
        the feast which follows, the Old Wife is placed at the head of the
        table, and as the whisky goes round each of the company drinks to
        her, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here's to the one that has
        helped us with the harvest.”</span> When the table has been cleared
        away and dancing begins, one of the lads leads out the Old Wife and
        dances with her; and if the night is fine the party will sometimes go
        out and march in a body to a considerable distance, singing
        harvest-songs, while one of them carries the Old Wife on his back.
        When the Harvest-Home is over, the Old Wife is shorn of her gear and
        used for ordinary purposes.<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469"

        she is taken down, and on the first day when the men go to plough she
        is divided among them by the mistress of the house. They take her in
        their pockets and give her to the horses to eat when they reach the
        field. This is supposed to secure good luck for the next harvest, and

        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        it up still exists in some farms of North Pembrokeshire, but the

        part of the country there used to be a competition between
        neighbouring farms to see which would finish reaping first. The
        foreman of the reapers planned so as to finish the reaping in a
        corner of the field out of sight of the people on the next farm.
        There, with the last handful of corn cut, he would make two Old Women
        or Hags (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrachs</span></span>). One of them he would send
        by a lad or other messenger to be laid secretly in the field where
        the neighbours were still at work cutting their corn. The messenger
        would disguise himself to look like a stranger, and jumping the fence
        and creeping through the corn he would lay the Hag (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrach</span></span>) in a place where the
        reapers in reaping would be sure to find it. Having done so he fled
        for dear life, for were the reapers to catch him they would shut him
        up in a dark room and not let him out till he had cleaned all the
        muddy boots, shoes, and clogs in the house. The second Hag
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrach</span></span>) was sent or taken by the
        foreman of the reapers to his master's farmhouse. Generally he tried
        to pop into the house unseen and lay the Hag on the kitchen table;
        but if the people of the farm caught him before he laid it down, they
        used to drench him with water. If a foreman succeeded in getting both
        the Hags (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrachs</span></span>) laid safe in their proper
        quarters, one at home, the other on a neighbour's farm, without

        County Antrim, down to some years ago, when the sickle was finally
        expelled by the reaping machine, the few stalks of corn left standing
        last on the field were plaited together; then the reapers,
        blindfolded, threw their sickles at the plaited corn, and whoever
        happened to cut it through took it home with him and put it over his
        door. This bunch of corn was called the Carley<a id="noteref_477"

        harvest-waggon and delivered, along with a garland, to the farmer by
        two girls. In binding the sheaves the women strive not to be last,

        Sometimes the harvesters call out to the woman who binds the last
        sheaf, <span class="tei tei-q">“She has the Baba,”</span> or
        <span class="tei tei-q">“She is the Baba.”</span> She has then to
        make a puppet, sometimes in female, sometimes in male form, out of
        the corn; the puppet is occasionally dressed with clothes, often with
        flowers and ribbons only. The cutter of the last stalks, as well as
        the binder of the last sheaf, was also called Baba; and a doll,
        called the Harvest-woman, was made out of the last sheaf and adorned
        with ribbons. The oldest reaper had to dance, first with this doll,
        and then with the farmer's wife.<a id="noteref_481" name=

        make a doll which they call the Corn-queen or Corn-mother; it is
        dressed in a woman's shirt, carried round the village, and then
        thrown into the river in order to secure plenty of rain and dew for

        which a Queen of the Corn-ears (<span lang="de" class=

        corn placed under her arm, and a scycle in her hand, carried out of
        the village in the morning of the conclusive reaping day, with music
        and much clamour of the reapers, into the field, where it stands
        fixed on a pole all day, and when the reaping is done, is brought
        home in like manner. This they call the Harvest Queen, and it

        refuge in the barn, where it appears in the last sheaf threshed,

        or has a bundle of straw fastened on his back. Whether wrapt in the
        straw or carrying it on his back, he is carted through the village
        amid general laughter. In some districts of Bavaria, Thüringen, and
        elsewhere, the man who threshes the last sheaf is said to have the

        and baked into a loaf. This loaf is believed to possess healing

        is still proceeding at another farm, he may go thither and rid
        himself of his burden, but must take care not to be caught. In this
        way a farmer who is behind-hand with his threshing may receive
        several such scarecrows, and so become the target for many gibes.
        Among the Germans of the Planer district in West Bohemia, the man who
        gives the last stroke at threshing is himself called <span class=

        parts of Sweden, when a stranger woman appears on the
        threshing-floor, a flail is put round her body, stalks of corn are
        wound round her neck, a crown of ears is placed on her head, and the
        threshers call out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold the
        Corn-woman.”</span> Here the stranger woman, thus suddenly appearing,
        is taken to be the corn-spirit who has just been expelled by the
        flails from the corn-stalks.<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501"

        other cases the farmer's wife represents the corn-spirit. Thus in the
        Commune of Saligné, Canton de Poiret (Vendée), the farmer's wife,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150"
        id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> along with the last sheaf, is
        tied up in a sheet, placed on a litter, and carried to the threshing
        machine, under which she is shoved. Then the woman is drawn out and
        the sheaf is threshed by itself, but the woman is tossed in the
        sheet, as if she were being winnowed.<a id="noteref_502" name=

        would be impossible to express more clearly the identification of the
        woman with the corn than by this graphic imitation of threshing and
        winnowing her. Mitigated forms of the custom are observed in various
        places. Thus among the Germans of Schüttarschen in West Bohemia it
        was customary at the close of the threshing to <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“throttle”</span> the farmer's wife by squeezing her neck
        between the arms of a flail till she consented to bake a special kind
        of cake called a <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "de"><span style="font-style: italic">drischala</span></span> (from
        <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=

        similar custom of <span class="tei tei-q">“throttling”</span> the
        farmer's wife at the threshing is practised in some parts of Bavaria,
        only there the pressure is applied by means of a straw rope instead
        of a flail.<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href=

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these customs
        the spirit of the ripe corn is regarded as old, or at least as of
        mature age. Hence the names of Mother, Grandmother, Old Woman, and so
        forth. But in other cases the corn-spirit is conceived as young. Thus
        at Saldern, near Wolfenbuttel, when the rye has been reaped, three
        sheaves are tied together with a rope so as to make a puppet with the
        corn ears for a head. This puppet is called the Maiden or the
        Corn-maiden (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

        Sometimes the corn-spirit is conceived as a child who is separated
        from its mother by the stroke of the sickle. This last view appears
        in the Polish custom of calling out to the man who cuts the last
        handful of corn, <span class="tei tei-q">“You have cut the
        navel-string.”</span><a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href=

        districts of West Prussia the figure made out of the last sheaf is
        called the Bastard, and a boy is wrapt up in it. The woman who binds
        the last sheaf and represents the Corn-mother is told that she is
        about to be brought to bed; she cries like a woman in travail, and an
        old woman in the character of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> grandmother acts as midwife. At last a cry is
        raised that the child is born; whereupon the boy who is tied up in
        the sheaf whimpers and squalls like an infant. The grandmother wraps
        a sack, in imitation of swaddling bands, round the pretended baby,
        who is carried joyfully to the barn, lest he should catch cold in the
        open air.<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href=

        other parts of North Germany the last sheaf, or the puppet made out

        England, particularly in the counties of Northumberland, Durham, and
        Yorkshire, the last corn cut on the field at harvest is or used to be
        variously known as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mell</span></span> or the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">churn</span></span> are merely local or
        dialectical variations. The corn so cut is either plaited or made up
        into a doll-like figure, which goes by the name of the mell-doll or
        the kirn-doll, or the kirn-baby, and is brought home with rejoicings
        at the end of the harvest.<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509"

        North Riding of Yorkshire the last sheaf gathered in is called the
        Mell-sheaf, and the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“We've gotten
        wer mell”</span> is as much as to say <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        Harvest is finished.”</span> Formerly a Mell-doll was made out of a
        sheaf of corn decked with flowers and wrapped in such of the reapers'
        garments as could be spared. It was carried with music and dancing to
        the scene of the harvest-supper, which was called the
        mell-supper.<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href=

        the north it was common for the reapers, on the last day of the
        reaping, <span class="tei tei-q">“to have a contention for
        superiority in quickness of dispatch, groups of three or four taking
        each a ridge, and striving which should soonest get to its
        termination. In Scotland, this was called a <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kemping</span></span>, which simply means a
        striving. In the north of England, it was a <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mell</span></span>.... As the reapers went on
        during the last day, they took care to leave a good handful of the
        grain uncut, but laid down flat, and covered over; and, when the
        field was done, the <span class="tei tei-q">‘bonniest lass’</span>
        was allowed to cut this final handful, which was presently dressed up
        with various sewings, tyings, and trimmings, like a doll, and hailed
        as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Corn
        Baby</span></em>. It was brought home in triumph, with music of
        fiddles and bagpipes, was set up conspicuously that night at supper,
        and was usually preserved in the farmer's parlour for the remainder
        of the year. The bonny lass who cut this handful of grain was deemed

        their sickles in turn at it, and the man who succeeded in cutting it
        through gave it to the girl he preferred. She made the corn so cut
        into a kirn-dolly and dressed it, and the doll was then taken to the
        farmhouse and hung up there till the next harvest, when its place was
        taken by the new kirn-dolly.<a id="noteref_517" name="noteref_517"

        Spottiswoode (Westruther Parish) in Berwickshire the reaping of the
        last corn at harvest was called <span class="tei tei-q">“cutting the
        Queen”</span> almost as often as <span class="tei tei-q">“cutting the
        kirn.”</span> The mode of cutting it was not by throwing sickles. One
        of the reapers consented to be blindfolded, and having been given a
        sickle in his hand <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
        154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        turned twice or thrice about by his fellows, he was bidden to go and
        cut the kirn. His groping about and making wild strokes in the air
        with his sickle excited much hilarity. When he had tired himself out
        in vain and given up the task as hopeless, another reaper was
        blindfolded and pursued the quest, and so on, one after the other,
        till at last the kirn was cut. The successful reaper was tossed up in
        the air with three cheers by his brother harvesters. To decorate the
        room in which the kirn-supper was held at Spottiswoode as well as the
        granary, where the dancing took place, two women made kirn-dollies or
        Queens every year; and many of these rustic effigies of the
        corn-spirit might be seen hanging up together.<a id="noteref_518"

        Lanfine in Ayrshire, down to near the end of the nineteenth century,
        the last bunch of standing corn at harvest was, occasionally at
        least, plaited together, and the reapers tried to cut it by throwing
        their sickles at it; when they failed in the attempt, a woman has
        been known to run in and sever the stalks at a blow. In Dumfriesshire
        also, within living memory, it used to be customary to cut the last
        standing corn by throwing the sickles at it.<a id="noteref_519" name=

        custom of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Winning the Churn’</span> was

        ago. It was carried out at the end of the harvest, or reaping the
        grain, on each farm or holding, were it small or large. Oats are the
        main crop of the district, but the custom was the same for other
        kinds of grain. When the reapers had nearly finished the last field a
        handful of the best-grown stalks was selected, carefully plaited as
        it stood, and fastened at the top just under the ears to keep the
        plait in place. Then when all the corn was cut from about this, which
        was known as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Churn</span></span>, and the sheaves about
        it had been removed to some distance, the reapers stood in a group

        of the farm, who gave the reaper a shilling.”</span> A supper and a
        dance of the reapers in the farmhouse often concluded the day. The
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        ribbons, was hung up on a wall in the farmhouse and carefully

        attach to the winning of the Maiden. If it is got by a young person,

        harvest. For that or other reasons there is a strife between the
        reapers as to who shall get the Maiden, and they resort to various
        stratagems for the purpose of securing it. One of them, for example,
        will often leave a handful of corn uncut and cover it up with earth
        to hide it from the other reapers, till all the rest of the corn on
        the field is cut down. Several may try to play the same trick, and
        the one who is coolest and holds out longest obtains the coveted
        distinction. When it has been cut, the Maiden is dressed with ribbons
        into a sort of doll and affixed to a wall of the farmhouse. In the

        sickle and the scythe, the young reapers of both sexes, when they
        neared the end of the last rig or field, used to manœuvre to gain
        possession of the <span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

        preserved and kept intact until the day they began leading home the
        corn. A tuft of it was then given to each of the horses, as they
        started from the corn-field with their first load. The rest of it was
        neatly made up, and hung in some conspicuous corner of the farmhouse,
        where it remained till it was replaced by a younger sister next
        season. On the first day of ploughing a tuft of it was given (as on
        the first day of leading home the corn) as a <span lang="gd" class=

        informed me that as a young girl she cut the Maiden several times at
        the request of the reapers in the neighbourhood of Perth. The name of
        the Maiden was given to the last handful of standing corn; a reaper
        held the top of the bunch while she cut it. Afterwards the bunch was
        plaited, decked with ribbons, and hung up in a conspicuous place on
        the wall of the kitchen till the next Maiden was brought in. The
        harvest-supper in this neighbourhood was also called the Maiden; the

        placed in some part of the kitchen, where everybody could see it

        not always the same. Here is another: three persons hold the band in
        their hands, one of them at each end, while the third holds the knot
        in the middle. Each handful of corn is placed so that the cut end is
        turned to the breast of those who support the ears on the opposite
        side. When all is cut, the youngest boy ties the knot. Two other
        bands are fastened to the sheaf, one near the cut end, the other near
        the ears. The sheaf is carried to the house by those who have helped
        to cut or bind it (Aberdour).</span></p>

        bands, it is cut straight, and it is not allowed to touch the ground.
        The youngest girls carry it to the house. My informant (a woman) told
        me that she had seen it decked and placed at the head of the bed.

        on the contrary the family is well off, they use other special
        utensils. In each dish ale is poured and treacle is added to sweeten

        a sufficient consistency. The cook adds whisky to the mixture in such
        proportion as she thinks fit. In each plate is put a ring. To allow
        the meal time to be completely absorbed, the dish is prepared on the
        morning of the feast. At the moment of the feast the dish or dishes
        containing the strong and savoury mixture are set on the middle of
        the table. But it is not served up till the end. Six or seven persons
        generally have a plate to themselves. Each of them plunges his spoon

        for he who is lucky enough to get it will be married within the year.

        Aberdeenshire customs the sanctity attributed to the last corn cut at
        harvest is clearly manifested, not merely by the ceremony with which
        it is treated on the field, in the house, and in the barn, but also
        by the great care taken to prevent it from touching the ground or
        being handled by any unchaste person. The reason why the youngest
        person on the field, whether a girl or a boy, is chosen to cut the
        last standing corn and sometimes to carry it to the house is no doubt
        a calculation that the younger the person the more likely is he or
        she to be sexually pure. We have seen that for this reason some

        Persephone, if my interpretation of these goddesses is right. We have
        seen that in Scotland, especially among the Gaelic-speaking

        the Rev. Mr. Campbell of Kilchrenan, on Loch Awe, furnished Dr. R. C.
        Maclagan with the following account of the Highland customs at
        harvest. The recollections of Mrs. MacCorquodale, then resident at
        Kilchrenan, refer to the customs practised about the middle of the
        nineteenth century in the wild and gloomy valley of Glencoe, infamous
        in history for the treacherous massacre perpetrated there by the
        Government troops in 1692. <span class="tei tei-q">“Mrs.
        MacCorquodale says that the rivalry was for the Maiden, and for the
        privilege she gave of sending the Cailleach to the next neighbour.
        The Maiden was represented by the last stalks reaped; the Cailleach
        by a handful taken at random from the field, perhaps the last rig of
        the reaper last to finish. The Cailleach was not dressed but carried
        after binding to the neighbour's field. The Maiden was cut in the
        following manner. All the reapers gathered round her and kept a short
        distance from her. They then threw their hooks [sickles] at her. The
        person successful in cutting her down in this manner was the man
        whose possession she became. Mrs. MacCorquodale understood that the
        man of a township who got the Cailleach finally was supposed to be
        doomed to poverty for his want of energy. (Gaelic: <span lang="gd"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A sample of the toast to the Cailleach at the harvest
        entertainment was as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Cailleach
        is with ... and is now with (me) since I was the last. I drink to her
        health. Since she assisted me in harvest, it is likely that it is
        with me she will abide during the winter.’</span> In explaining the
        above toast Mr. Campbell says that it signifies that the Cailleach is
        always with agriculturists. <span class="tei tei-q">‘She has been
        with others before and is now with me (the proposer of the toast).
        Though I did my best to avoid her I welcome her as my assistant, and
        am prepared to entertain her during the winter.’</span> Another form
        of the toast was as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">‘To your health,
        good wife, who for harvest has come to help us, and if I live I'll
        try to support you when winter comes.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“John MacCorquodale, Kilchrenan, says that at Crianlarich
        in Strath Fillan, they make a Cailleach of sticks and a turnip, old
        clothes and a pipe. In this case the effigy passed in succession to
        seven farms, which he mentioned, and finally settled with an
        innkeeper. The list suggested that the upper farms stood a bad
        chance, and perhaps that a prosperous innkeeper could more easily
        bear up against the reproach and loss (?) of supporting the
        Cailleach.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Duncan MacIntyre, Kilchrenan, says that in one case
        where the last field to be reaped was the most fertile land on the
        farm, the corn first cut in it, which was taken near the edge, was
        reserved to make a Cailleach, should the owner be so happy as to be
        able to pass her on to his neighbour. The last blades cut were
        generally in the middle or best part of the field. These in any event
        became the Maiden.”</span> Lastly, Dr. Maclagan observes that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“having directed the attention of Miss Kerr,
        Port Charlotte, Islay, to the practice of having two different
        bunches on the mainland of Argyle, she informs me that in Islay and
        Kintyre the last handful is the Cailleach, and they have no Maiden.
        The same is the custom in Bernara and other parts of the Western
        Isles, while in Mull the last handful is the Maiden, and they have no
        Cailleach. In North Uist the habit still prevails of putting the
        Cailleach over-night among the standing corn of lazy
        crofters.”</span><a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href=

        Old Wife (<span lang="gd" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "gd"><span style="font-style: italic">Cailleach</span></span>) are
        fashioned out of the reaped corn at harvest, the Maiden is always
        made out of the last stalks left standing, and is kept by the farmer
        on whose land it was cut; while the Old Wife is made out of other
        stalks, sometimes out of the first stalks cut, and is regularly
        passed on to a laggard farmer who happens to be still reaping after
        his brisker neighbour has cut all his corn. Thus while each farmer
        keeps his own Maiden, as the embodiment of the young and fruitful
        spirit of the corn, he passes on the Old Wife as soon as he can to a
        neighbour, and so the old lady may make the round of all the farms in
        the district before she finds a place in which to lay her venerable
        head. The farmer with whom she finally takes up her abode is of
        course the one who has been the last of all the countryside to finish
        reaping his crops, and thus the distinction of entertaining her is
        rather an invidious one. Similarly we saw that in Pembrokeshire,
        where the last corn cut is called, not the Maiden, but the Hag, she
        is passed on hastily to a neighbour who is still at work in his
        fields and who receives his aged visitor with anything but a
        transport of joy. If the Old Wife represents the corn-spirit of the
        past year, as she probably does wherever she is contrasted with and
        opposed to a Maiden, it is natural enough that her faded charms
        should have less attractions for the husbandman than the buxom form
        of her daughter, who may be expected to become in her turn the mother
        of the golden grain when the revolving year has brought round another
        autumn. The same desire to get rid of the effete Mother of the Corn
        by palming her off on other people comes out clearly in some of the
        customs observed at the close of threshing, particularly in the
        practice of passing on a hideous straw puppet to a neighbour farmer
        who is still threshing his corn.<a id="noteref_549" name=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The harvest
        customs just described are strikingly analogous to the spring customs
        which we reviewed in the first part of this work. (1) As in the
        spring customs the tree-spirit is represented both by a tree and by a
        person,<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href=
        "#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the harvest customs the
        corn-spirit is represented both by the last sheaf and by the person
        who cuts or binds or threshes it. The equivalence of the person to
        the sheaf is shewn by giving him or her the same name as the sheaf;
        by wrapping him or her in it; and by the rule observed in some
        places, that when the sheaf is called the Mother, it must be made up
        into human shape by the oldest married woman, but that when it is
        called the Maiden, it must be cut by the youngest girl.<a id=
        "noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a> Here
        the age of the personal representative of the corn-spirit corresponds
        with that of the supposed age of the corn-spirit, just as the human
        victims offered by the Mexicans to promote the growth of the maize
        varied with the age of the maize.<a id="noteref_552" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> For in
        the Mexican, as in the European, custom the human beings were
        probably representatives of the corn-spirit rather than victims
        offered to it. (2) Again, the same fertilising influence which the
        tree-spirit is supposed to exert over vegetation, cattle, and even
        women<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href=
        "#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a> is
        ascribed to the corn-spirit. Thus, its supposed influence on
        vegetation is shewn by the practice of taking some of the grain of
        the last sheaf (in which the corn-spirit is regularly supposed to be
        present), and scattering it among the young corn in spring or mixing
        it with the seed-corn.<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href=
        "#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> Its
        influence on animals is shewn by giving the last sheaf to a mare in
        foal, to a cow in calf, and to horses at the first ploughing.<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> Lastly,
        its influence on women is indicated by the custom of delivering the
        Mother-sheaf, made into the likeness of a pregnant woman, to the
        farmer's wife;<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href=

        nature. Their names are general, not proper. Their attributes are
        generic, rather than individual; in other words, there is an
        indefinite number of spirits of each class, and the individuals of a

        province; but they are not rigorously confined to it; they can exert
        their power for good or evil in many other spheres of nature and
        life. Again, they bear individual or proper names, such as Demeter,

        may be performed by any one, master or man, mistress or maid, boy or
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170"
        id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> girl; they are practised, not
        in temples or churches, but in the woods and meadows, beside brooks,
        in barns, on harvest fields and cottage floors. The supernatural
        beings whose existence is taken for granted in them are spirits
        rather than deities: their functions are limited to certain
        well-defined departments of nature: their names are general, like the
        Barley-mother, the Old Woman, the Maiden, not proper names like
        Demeter, Persephone, Dionysus. Their generic attributes are known,
        but their individual histories and characters are not the subject of
        myths. For they exist in classes rather than as individuals, and the
        members of each class are indistinguishable. For example, every farm
        has its Corn-mother, or its Old Woman, or its Maiden; but every
        Corn-mother is much like every other Corn-mother, and so with the Old
        Women and Maidens. Lastly, in these harvest, as in the spring
        customs, the ritual is magical rather than propitiatory. This is
        shewn by throwing the Corn-mother into the river in order to secure
        rain and dew for the crops;<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560"

          peoples, ancient and modern, have not been singular in personifying
          the corn as a mother goddess. The same simple idea has suggested
          itself to other agricultural races in distant parts of the world,
          and has been applied by them to other indigenous cereals than
          barley and wheat. If Europe has its Wheat-mother and its
          Barley-mother, America has its Maize-mother and the East Indies
          their Rice-mother. These personifications I will now illustrate,
          beginning with the American personification of the maize.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that among European peoples it is a common custom to keep the

          intention no doubt is, or rather originally was, by preserving the
          representative of the corn-spirit to maintain the spirit itself in
          life and activity throughout the year, in order that the corn may
          grow and the crops be good. This interpretation of the custom is at
          all events rendered highly probable by a similar custom observed by
          the ancient Peruvians, and thus described by the old Spanish
          historian Acosta:—<span class="tei tei-q">“They take a certain
          portion of the most fruitful of the maize that grows in their
          farms, the which they put in a certain granary which they do call
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it in great veneration, saying it is
          the mother of the maize of their inheritances, and that by this
          means the maize augments and is preserved. In this month [the sixth
          month, answering to May] they make a particular sacrifice, and the
          witches demand of this <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          sufficient to continue until the next year; and if it answers no,
          then they carry this maize to the farm to burn, whence they brought

          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pirua</span></span>, with the same ceremonies,
          saying that they renew it, to the end the seed of maize may not
          perish, and if it answers that it hath force sufficient to last
          longer, they leave it until the next year. This foolish vanity
          continueth to this day, and it is very common amongst the Indians
          to have these <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
          description of the custom there seems to be some error. Probably it
          was the dressed-up bunch of maize, not the granary (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pirua</span></span>), which was worshipped by
          the Peruvians and regarded as the Mother of the Maize. This is
          confirmed by what we know of the Peruvian custom from another
          source. The Peruvians, we are told, believed all useful plants to
          be animated by a divine being who causes their growth. According to
          the particular plant, these divine beings were called the
          Maize-mother (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Zara-mama</span></span>), the Quinoa-mother
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Coca-mama</span></span>), and the
          Potato-mother (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Axo-mama</span></span>). Figures of these
          divine mothers were made respectively of ears of maize and leaves
          of the quinoa and coca plants; they were dressed in women's clothes
          and worshipped. Thus the Maize-mother was represented by a puppet
          made of stalks of maize dressed in full female attire; and the
          Indians believed that <span class="tei tei-q">“as mother, it had
          the power of producing and giving birth to much
          maize.”</span><a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href=

          Probably, therefore, Acosta misunderstood <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> his informant, and the Mother of the Maize
          which he describes was not the granary (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pirua</span></span>), but the bunch of maize
          dressed in rich vestments. The Peruvian Mother of the Maize, like
          the harvest-Maiden at Balquhidder, was kept for a year in order
          that by her means the corn might grow and multiply. But lest her
          strength might not suffice to last <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> till the next harvest, she was asked in the
          course of the year how she felt, and if she answered that she felt
          weak, she was burned and a fresh Mother of the Maize made,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to the end the seed of maize may not
          perish.”</span> Here, it may be observed, we have a strong
          confirmation of the explanation already given of the custom of
          killing the god, both periodically and occasionally. The Mother of
          the Maize was allowed, as a rule, to live through a year, that
          being the period during which her strength might reasonably be
          supposed to last unimpaired; but on any symptom of her strength
          failing she was put to death, and a fresh and vigorous Mother of
          the Maize took her place, lest the maize which depended on her for
          its existence should languish and decay.</p>

          clearly does the same train of thought come out in the harvest
          customs formerly observed by the Zapotecs of Mexico. At harvest the
          priests, attended by the nobles and people, went in procession to
          the maize fields, where they picked out the largest and finest
          sheaf. This they took with great ceremony to the town or village,
          and placed it in the temple upon an altar adorned with wild
          flowers. After sacrificing to the harvest god, the priests
          carefully wrapped up the sheaf in fine linen and kept it till
          seed-time. Then the priests and nobles met again at the temple, one
          of them bringing the skin of a wild beast, elaborately ornamented,
          in which the linen cloth containing the sheaf was enveloped. The
          sheaf was then carried once more in procession to the field from
          which it had been taken. Here a small cavity or subterranean
          chamber had been prepared, in which the precious sheaf was
          deposited, wrapt in its various envelopes. After sacrifice had been
          offered to the gods of the fields for an abundant crop the chamber
          was closed and covered over with earth. Immediately thereafter the
          sowing began. Finally, when the time of harvest drew near, the
          buried sheaf was solemnly disinterred by the priests, who
          distributed the grain to all who asked for it. The packets of grain
          so distributed were carefully preserved as talismans till the

          quicken the growth of the maize.</p>

          some extent different account of the ancient Mexican worship of the
          maize has been given us by the Franciscan monk Bernardino de
          Sahagun, who arrived in Mexico in 1529, only eight years after its
          conquest by the Spaniards, and devoted the remaining sixty-one
          years of his long life to labouring among the Indians for their
          moral and spiritual good. Uniting the curiosity of a scientific
          enquirer to the zeal of a missionary, and adorning both qualities
          with the humanity and benevolence of a good man, he obtained from
          the oldest and most learned of the Indians accounts of their
          ancient customs and beliefs, and embodied them in a work which, for
          combined interest of matter and fulness of detail, has perhaps
          never been equalled in the records of aboriginal peoples brought
          into contact with European civilisation. This great document, after
          lying neglected in the dust of Spanish archives for centuries, was
          discovered and published almost simultaneously in Mexico and
          England in the first half of the nineteenth century. It exists in
          the double form of an Aztec text and a Spanish translation, both
          due to Sahagun himself. Only the Spanish version has hitherto been
          published in full, but the original Aztec text, to judge by the few
          extracts of it which have been edited and translated, appears to
          furnish much more ample details on many points, and in the interest
          of learning it is greatly to be desired that a complete edition and
          translation of it should be given to the world.</p>

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the worship of the Maize-goddess and
          the ceremonies observed by the Mexicans for the purpose of ensuring
          a good crop of maize. The festival was the fourth of the Aztec
          year, and went by the name of the Great Vigil. It fell on a date
          which corresponds to the seventh of April. The name of the
          Maize-goddess was Chicome couatl, and the Mexicans conceived and
          represented her in the form of a woman, red in face and arms and
          legs, wearing a paper crown dyed vermilion, and clad in garments of
          the hue of ripe cherries. No doubt the red colour of the goddess
          and her garments referred to the deep orange hue of the ripe maize;
          it was like the yellow hair of the Greek corn-goddess Demeter. She
          was supposed to make all kinds of maize, beans, and vegetables to
          grow. On the day of the festival the Mexicans sent out to the
          maize-fields and fetched from every field a plant of maize, which
          they brought to their houses and greeted as their maize-gods,
          setting them up in their dwellings, clothing them in garments, and
          placing food before them. And after sunset they carried the
          maize-plants to the temple of the Maize-goddess, where they
          snatched them from one another and fought and struck each other
          with them. Further, at this festival they brought to the temple of
          the Maize-goddess the maize-cobs which were to be used in the
          sowing. The cobs were carried by three maidens in bundles of seven
          wrapt in red paper. One of the girls was small with short hair,
          another was older with long hair hanging down, and the third was
          full-grown with her hair wound round her head. Red feathers were
          gummed to the arms and legs of the three maidens and their faces
          were painted, probably to resemble the red Maize-goddess, whom they
          may be supposed to have personated at various stages of the growth
          of the corn. The maize-cobs which they brought to the temple of the
          Maize-goddess were called by the name of the Maize-god Cinteotl,
          and they were afterwards deposited in the granary <span class=

          cultivation of maize, generally conceived the spirit of the maize
          as a woman, and supposed that the plant itself had sprung
          originally from the blood drops or the dead body of the Corn Woman.
          In the sacred formulas of the Cherokee the corn is sometimes
          invoked as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Old Woman,”</span> and one
          of their myths relates how a hunter saw a fair woman issue from a
          single green stalk of corn.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570"

          Iroquois believe the Spirit of the Corn, the Spirit of Beans, and
          the Spirit of Squashes to be three sisters clad in the leaves of
          their respective plants, very fond of each other, and delighting to
          dwell together. This divine trinity is known by the name of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Our Life”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Our Supporters.”</span> The three persons of the
          trinity have no individual names, and are never mentioned
          separately except by means of description. The Indians have a
          legend that of old the corn was easily cultivated, yielded
          abundantly, and had a grain exceedingly rich in oil, till the Evil
          One, envious of this good gift of the Great Spirit to man, went
          forth into the fields and blighted them. And still, when the wind
          rustles in the corn, the pious Indian fancies he hears the Spirit
          of the Corn bemoaning her blighted fruitfulness.<a id="noteref_571"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conception
          of the corn-spirit as a bride seems to come out clearly in a
          ceremony still practised by the Berbers near Tangier, in Morocco.
          When the women assemble in the fields to weed the green barley or
          reap the crops, they take with them a straw figure dressed like a
          woman, and set it up among the corn. Suddenly a group of horsemen
          from a neighbouring village gallops up and carries off the straw
          puppet amid the screams and cries of the women. However, the
          ravished effigy is rescued by another band of mounted men, and
          after a struggle it remains, more or less dishevelled, in the hands
          of the women. That this pretended abduction is a mimic marriage
          appears from a Berber custom in accordance with which, at a real
          wedding, the bridegroom carries off his seemingly unwilling bride
          on horseback, while she screams and pretends to summon her friends
          to her rescue. No fixed date is appointed for the simulated
          abduction of the straw woman from the barley-field, the time
          depends upon the state of the crops, but the day and hour are made
          public before the event. Each village used to practise this mimic
          contest for possession of the straw woman, who probably represents
          the Barley Bride, but nowadays the custom is growing
          obsolete.<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An earlier
          account of what seems to be the same practice runs as follows:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“There is a curious custom which seems to
          be a relic of their pagan masters, who made this and the adjoining
          regions of North Africa the main granary of their Latin empire.
          When the young corn has sprung up, which it does about the middle
          of February, the women of the villages make up the figure of a
          female, the size of a very large doll, which they dress in the
          gaudiest fashion they can contrive, covering it with ornaments to
          which all in the village contribute something; and they give it a
          tall, peaked head-dress. This image they carry in procession round
          their fields, screaming and singing a peculiar ditty. The doll is
          borne by the foremost woman, who must yield it to any one who is
          quick enough to take the lead of her, which is the cause of much
          racing and squabbling. The men also have a similar custom, which
          they perform on horseback. They call the image Mata. These
          ceremonies are said by the people to bring good luck. Their
          efficacy ought to be great, for you frequently see crowds of men
          engaged in their performances running and galloping recklessly over
          the young crops of wheat and barley. Such customs are directly
          opposed to the faith of Islam, and I never met with a Moor who
          could in any way enlighten me as to their origin. The Berber
          tribes, the most ancient race now remaining in these regions, to
          which they give the name, are the only ones which retain this
          antique usage, and it is viewed by the Arabs and dwellers in the
          town as a remnant of idolatry.”</span><a id="noteref_575" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a> We
          may conjecture that this gaudily dressed effigy of a female, which
          the Berber women carry about their fields when the corn is
          sprouting, represents the Corn-mother, and that the procession is
          designed to promote the growth of the crops by imparting to them
          the quickening influence of the goddess. We can therefore
          understand why there should be a competition among the women for
          the possession of the effigy; each woman probably hopes to secure
          for herself and her crops a larger measure of fertility by
          appropriating the image of the Corn-mother. The competition on
          horseback among the men is no doubt to be <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> explained similarly; they, too, race with
          each other in their eagerness to possess themselves of an effigy,
          perhaps of a male power of the corn, by whose help they expect to
          procure a heavy crop. Such contests for possession of the
          corn-spirit embodied in the corn-stalks are common, as we have
          seen, among the reapers on the harvest fields of Europe. Perhaps
          they help to explain some of the contests in the Eleusinian games,
          among which horse-races as well as foot-races were included.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the reader
          still feels any doubts as to the meaning of the harvest customs
          which have been practised within living memory by European
          peasants, these doubts may perhaps be dispelled by comparing the
          customs observed at the rice-harvest by the Malays and Dyaks of the
          East Indies. For these Eastern peoples have not, like our
          peasantry, advanced beyond the intellectual stage at which the
          customs originated; their theory and their practice are still in
          unison; for them the quaint rites which in Europe have long
          dwindled into mere fossils, the pastime of clowns and the puzzle of
          the learned, are still living realities of which they can render an
          intelligible and truthful account. Hence a study of their beliefs
          and usages concerning the rice may throw some light on the true
          meaning of the ritual of the corn in ancient Greece and modern
          Europe.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the whole of
          the ritual which the Malays and Dyaks observe in connexion with the
          rice is founded on the simple conception of the rice as animated by
          a soul like that which these people attribute to mankind. They
          explain the phenomena of reproduction, growth, decay and death in
          the rice on the same principles on which they explain the
          corresponding phenomena in human beings. They imagine that in the
          fibres of the plant, as in the body of a man, there is a certain
          vital element, which is so far independent of the plant that it may
          for a time be completely separated from it without fatal effects,
          though if its absence be prolonged beyond certain limits the plant
          will wither and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg
          181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          die. This vital yet separable element is what, for the want of a
          better word, we must call the soul of a plant, just as a similar
          vital and separable element is commonly supposed to constitute the
          soul of man; and on this theory or myth of the plant-soul is built
          the whole worship of the cereals, just as on the theory or myth of
          the human soul is built the whole worship of the dead,—a towering
          superstructure reared on a slender and precarious foundation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strict
          parallelism between the Indonesian ideas about the soul of man and
          the soul of rice is well brought out by Mr. R. J. Wilkinson in the
          following passage: <span class="tei tei-q">“The spirit of
          life,—which, according to the ancient Indonesian belief, existed in
          all things, even in what we should now consider inanimate
          objects—is known as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sĕmangat</span></span>. It was not a
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘soul’</span> in the modern English sense,
          since it was not the exclusive possession of mankind, its
          separation from the body did not necessarily mean death, and its
          nature may possibly not have been considered immortal. At the
          present day, if a Malay feels faint, he will describe his condition
          by saying that his <span class="tei tei-q">‘spirit of life’</span>
          is weak or is <span class="tei tei-q">‘flying’</span> from his
          body; he sometimes appeals to it to return: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Hither, hither, bird of my soul.’</span> Or again, if
          a Malay lover wishes to influence the mind of a girl, he may seek
          to obtain control of her <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sĕmangat</span></span>, for he believes that
          this spirit of active and vigorous life must quit the body when the
          body sleeps and so be liable to capture by the use of magic arts.
          It is, however, in the ceremonies connected with the so-called
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘spirit of the rice-crops’</span> that the
          peculiar characteristics of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sĕmangat</span></span> come out most clearly.
          The Malay considers it essential that the spirit of life should not
          depart from the rice intended for next year's sowing as otherwise
          the dead seed would fail to produce any crop whatever. He,
          therefore, approaches the standing rice-crops at harvest-time in a
          deprecatory manner; he addresses them in endearing terms; he offers
          propitiatory sacrifices; he fears that he may scare away the
          timorous <span class="tei tei-q">‘bird of life’</span> by the sight
          of a weapon or the least sign of violence. He must reap the
          seed-rice, but he does it with a knife of peculiar shape, such that
          the cruel blade is hidden away beneath the reaper's fingers and
          does not alarm the <span class="tei tei-q">‘soul of the
          rice.’</span> When once the seed-rice <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> has been harvested, more expeditious
          reaping-tools may be employed, since it is clearly unnecessary to
          retain the spirit of life in grain that is only intended for the
          cooking-pot. Similar rites attend all the processes of
          rice-cultivation—the sowing and the planting-out as well as the
          harvest,—for at each of these stages there is a risk that the
          vitality of the crop may be ruined if the bird of life is scared
          away. In the language used by the high-priests of these very
          ancient ceremonies we constantly find references to Sri (the Hindu
          Goddess of the Crops), to the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, and
          to Adam who, according to Moslem tradition, was the first planter
          of cereals;—many of these references only represent the attempts of
          the conservative Malays to make their old religions harmonize with
          later beliefs. Beneath successive layers of religious veneer, we
          see the animism of the old Indonesians, the theory of a bird-spirit
          of life, and the characteristic view that the best protection
          against evil lies in gentleness and courtesy to all animate and
          inanimate things.”</span><a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577"

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘soul-stuff.’</span> Since rice is
          everywhere cultivated in the Indian Archipelago, and with some
          exceptions is the staple food, we need not wonder that the
          Indonesian conceives the rice to be not merely animated in the
          ordinary sense but to be possessed of a soul-stuff which in
          strength and dignity ranks with that of man. Thus the Bataks apply
          the same word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tondi</span></span> to the soul-stuff of rice
          and the soul-stuff of human beings. Whereas the Dyaks of Poelopetak
          give the name of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gana</span></span> to the soul-stuff of
          things, animals, and plants, they give the name of <span class=

          183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          man. So also the inhabitants of Halmahera call the soul-stuff of
          things and plants <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">giki</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          recognise a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gurumi</span></span>. Of the Javanese, Malays,
          Macassars, Buginese, and the inhabitants of the island of Buru we
          know that they ascribe a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "font-style: italic">sĕmangat</span></span> to rice as well as to
          men. So it is with the Toradjas of Central Celebes; while they
          manifestly conceive all things and plants as animated, they
          attribute a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tanoana</span></span> or soul-stuff only to
          men, animals, and rice. It need hardly be said that this custom
          originates in the very high value that is set on
          rice.”</span><a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href=

          bloom as they behave towards a pregnant woman; they abstain from
          firing guns or making loud noises in the field, lest they should so
          frighten the soul of the rice that it would miscarry and bear no
          grain; and for the same reason they will not talk of corpses or
          demons in the rice-fields. Moreover, they feed the blooming rice
          with foods of various kinds which are believed to be wholesome for
          women with child; but when the rice-ears are just beginning to
          form, they are looked upon as infants, and women go through the

          necessity of cutting down the rice with the knife. At so critical a
          season every precaution must be used to render the necessary

          is swept off almost before she is aware; and from a like delicate
          motive the reapers at work in the fields employ a special form of

          cultivation of rice, which furnishes their staple food; their
          religion is deeply coloured by this main occupation of their lives,

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to
          secure and detain the volatile soul of the rice the Kayans resort
          to a number of devices. Among the instruments employed for this
          purpose are a miniature ladder, a spatula, and a basket containing
          hooks, thorns, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg
          185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          cords. With the spatula the priestess strokes the soul of the rice
          down the little ladder into the basket, where it is naturally held
          fast by the hooks, the thorn, and the cord; and having thus
          captured and imprisoned the soul she conveys it into the
          rice-granary. Sometimes a bamboo box and a net are used for the
          same purpose. And in order to ensure a good harvest for the
          following year it is necessary not only to detain the soul of all
          the grains of rice which are safely stored in the granary, but also
          to attract and recover the soul of all the rice that has been lost
          through falling to the earth or being eaten by deer, apes, and
          pigs. For this purpose instruments of various sorts have been
          invented by the priests. One, for example, is a bamboo vessel
          provided with four hooks made from the wood of a fruit-tree, by
          means of which the absent rice-soul may be hooked and drawn back
          into the vessel, which is then hung up in the house. Sometimes two
          hands carved out of the wood of a fruit-tree are used for the same
          purpose. And every time that a Kayan housewife fetches rice from
          the granary for the use of her household, she must propitiate the
          souls of the rice in the granary, lest they should be angry at
          being robbed of their substance. To keep them in good humour a
          bundle of shavings of a fruit-tree and a little basket are always
          hung in the granary. An egg and a small vessel containing the juice
          of sugar-cane are attached as offerings to the bundle of shavings,
          and the basket contains a sacred mat, which is used at fetching the
          rice. When the housewife comes to fetch rice from the granary, she
          pours juice of the sugar-cane on the egg, takes the sacred mat from
          the basket, spreads it on the ground, lays a stalk of rice on it,
          and explains to the souls of the rice the object of her coming.
          Then she kneels before the mat, mutters some prayers or spells,
          eats a single grain from the rice-stalk, and having restored the
          various objects to their proper place, departs from the granary
          with the requisite amount of rice, satisfied that she has
          discharged her religious duty to the spirits of the rice. At
          harvest the spirits of the rice are propitiated with offerings of
          food and water, which are carried by children to the rice-fields.
          At evening the first rice-stalks which have been cut are solemnly

          represent spirits; for, believing that spirits are mightier than

          support their assumed character they wear grotesque masks with
          goggle eyes, great teeth, huge ears, and beards of white goat's
          hair, while their bodies are so thickly wrapt up in shredded
          banana-leaves that to the spectator they present the appearance of
          unwieldy masses of green foliage. The leader of the band carries a
          long wooden hook or rather crook, the shaft of which is partly
          whittled into loose fluttering shavings. These disguises they don
          at a little distance from the village, then dropping down the river
          in boats they land and march in procession to an open space among
          the houses, where the people, dressed out in all their finery, are
          waiting to witness the performance. Here the maskers range
          themselves in a circle and dance for some time under the burning
          rays of the midday sun, waving their arms, shaking and turning
          their heads, and executing a variety of steps to the sound of a
          gong, which is beaten according to a rigidly prescribed rhythm.
          After the dance they form a line, one behind the other, to fetch
          the vagrant soul of the rice from far countries. At the head of the
          procession marches the leader holding high his crook and behind him
          follow all the other masked men in their leafy costume, each
          holding his fellow by the hand. As he strides along, the leader
          makes a motion with his crook as if he were hooking something and
          drawing it to himself, and the gesture is imitated by all his
          followers. What <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg

          he is thus catching are the souls of the rice, which sometimes
          wander far away, and by drawing them home to the village he is
          believed to ensure that the seed of the rice which is about to be
          sown will produce a plentiful harvest. As the spirits are thought
          not to possess the power of speech, the actors who personate them
          may not utter a word, else they would run the risk of falling down
          dead. The great field of the chief is sown by representatives of
          all the families, both free and slaves, on the day after the
          masquerade. On the same day the free families sacrifice on their
          fields and begin their sowing on one or other of the following
          days. Every family sets up in its field a sacrificial stage or
          altar, with which the sowers must remain in connexion during the
          time of sowing. Therefore no stranger may pass between them and the
          stage; indeed the Kayans are not allowed to have anything to do
          with strangers in the fields; above all they may not speak with
          them. If such a thing should accidentally happen, the sowing must
          cease for that day. At the sowing festival, but at no other time,
          Kayan men of the Mahakam river, like their brethren of the Mendalam
          river, amuse themselves with spinning tops. For nine days before
          the masquerade takes place the people are bound to observe certain
          taboos: no stranger may enter the village: no villager may pass the
          night out of his own house: they may not hunt, nor pluck fruits,
          nor fish with the casting-net or the drag-net.<a id="noteref_587"

          planted with their other seeds, and is thus propagated and
          communicated.”</span> The mode of securing the soul of the rice
          varies in different tribes. In the Quop district the ceremony is
          performed by the chief priest alone, first in the long broad
          verandah of the common house and afterwards in each separate family
          apartment. As a preparation for the ceremony a bamboo altar,
          decorated with green boughs and red and white streamers, is erected
          in the verandah, and presents a very gay appearance. Here the
          people, old and young, assemble, the priestesses dressed in
          gorgeous array and the elder men wearing bright-coloured jackets
          and trousers of purple, yellow, or scarlet hue, while the young men
          and lads beat gongs and drums. When the priest, with a bundle of
          charms in either hand, is observed to be gazing earnestly in the
          air at something invisible to common eyes, the band strikes up with
          redoubled energy, and the elderly men in the gay breeches begin to
          shriek and revolve round the altar in the dance. Suddenly the
          priest starts up and makes a rush at the invisible object; men run
          to him with white cloths, and as he shakes his charms over the
          cloths a few grains of rice fall into them. These grains are the
          soul of the rice; they are carefully folded up in the cloths and
          laid at the foot of the altar. The same performance is afterwards
          repeated in every family apartment. In some tribes the soul of the
          rice is secured at midnight. Outside the village a lofty altar is
          erected in an open space surrounded by the stately forms of the
          tropical palms. Huge bonfires cast a ruddy glow over the scene and
          light up the dusky but picturesque forms of the Dyaks as they move
          in slow and solemn dance round the altar, some <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bearing lighted tapers in their hands,
          others brass salvers with offerings of rice, others covered
          baskets, of which the contents are hidden from all but the
          initiated. The corner-posts of the altar are lofty bamboos, whose
          leafy tops are yet green and rustle in the wind; and from one of
          them a long narrow streamer of white cloth hangs down. Suddenly
          elders and priests rush at this streamer, seize the end of it, and
          amid the crashing music of drums and gongs and the yells of the
          spectators begin dancing and swaying themselves backwards and
          forwards, and to and fro. A priest or elder mounts the altar amid
          the shouts of the bystanders and shakes the tall bamboos violently;
          and in the midst of all this excitement and hubbub small stones,
          bunches of hair, and grains of rice fall at the feet of the
          dancers, and are carefully picked up by watchful attendants. These
          grains are the soul of the rice. The ceremony ends with several of
          the oldest priestesses falling, or pretending to fall, senseless to
          the ground, where, till they come to themselves, their heads are
          supported and their faces fanned by their younger colleagues. At
          the end of the harvest, when the year's crop has been garnered,
          another feast is held. A pig and fowls are killed, and for four
          days gongs are beaten and dancing kept up. For eight days the
          village is tabooed and no stranger may enter it. At this festival
          the ceremony of catching the soul of the rice is repeated to
          prevent the crop from rotting; and the soul so obtained is mixed
          with the seed-rice of the next year.<a id="noteref_589" name=

          of which both top and bottom are carefully closed with wood to

          in their bullock-cart, taking with them a woman's comb, a
          looking-glass, and a woman's skirt. The sheaf is dressed in the
          skirt, and apparently the form is gone through of presenting
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name=

          the cart with their silk kerchiefs, and cheering and singing the
          whole way. On their arrival home they celebrate the occasion with a
          feast. Strictly speaking the sheaf should be kept apart from the
          rest of the harvest; owing, however, to the high price of paddy it
          often finds its way to the threshing-floor. Even when this is not
          the case it is rarely tended so carefully as it is said to have
          been in former days, and if not threshed with the remaining crop is
          apt to be eaten by the cattle. So far as I could ascertain it had
          never been the custom to keep it throughout the year; but on the
          first ploughing of the ensuing season there was some ceremony in
          connection with it. The name of the sheaf was <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Corn-mother
          of our European peasants has her match in the Rice-mother of the
          Minangkabauers of Sumatra. The Minangkabauers definitely attribute
          a soul to rice, and will sometimes assert that rice pounded in the
          usual way tastes better than rice ground in a mill, because in the
          mill the body of the rice was so bruised and battered that the soul
          has fled from it. Like the Javanese they think that the rice is
          under the special guardianship of a female spirit called Saning
          Sari, who is conceived as so closely knit up with the plant that
          the rice often goes by her name, as with the Romans the corn might
          be called Ceres. In particular Saning Sari is represented by
          certain stalks or grains called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">indoea
          padi</span></span>, that is, literally, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mother of Rice,”</span> a name that is often given to
          the guardian spirit herself. This so-called Mother of Rice is the
          occasion of a number of ceremonies observed at the planting and
          harvesting of the rice as well as during its preservation in the
          barn. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name=
          "Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> When the seed of the
          rice is about to be sown in the nursery or bedding-out ground,
          where under the wet system of cultivation it is regularly allowed
          to sprout before being transplanted to the fields, the best grains
          are picked out to form the Rice-mother. These are then sown in the
          middle of the bed, and the common seed is planted round about them.
          The state of the Rice-mother is supposed to exert the greatest
          influence on the growth of the rice; if she droops or pines away,
          the harvest will be bad in consequence. The woman who sows the
          Rice-mother in the nursery lets her hair hang loose and afterwards
          bathes, as a means of ensuring an abundant harvest. When the time
          comes to transplant the rice from the nursery to the field, the
          Rice-mother receives a special place either in the middle or in a
          corner of the field, and a prayer or charm is uttered as follows:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Saning Sari, may a measure of rice come
          from a stalk of rice and a basketful from a root; may you be
          frightened neither by lightning nor by passers-by! Sunshine make
          you glad; with the storm may you be at peace; and may rain serve to
          wash your face!”</span> While the rice is growing, the particular
          plant which was thus treated as the Rice-mother is lost sight of;
          but before harvest another Rice-mother is found. When the crop is
          ripe for cutting, the oldest woman of the family or a sorcerer goes
          out to look for her. The first stalks seen to bend under a passing
          breeze are the Rice-mother, and they are tied together but not cut
          until the first-fruits of the field have been carried home to serve
          as a festal meal for the family and their friends, nay even for the
          domestic animals; since it is Saning Sari's pleasure that the
          beasts also should partake of her good gifts. After the meal has
          been eaten, the Rice-mother is fetched home by persons in gay
          attire, who carry her very carefully under an umbrella in a neatly
          worked bag to the barn, where a place in the middle is assigned to
          her. Every one believes that she takes care of the rice in the barn
          and even multiplies it not uncommonly.<a id="noteref_595" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Tomori
          of Central Celebes are about to plant the rice, they bury in the
          field some betel as an offering to the spirits who cause the rice
          to grow. Over the spot where the offering is buried a small floor
          of wood is laid, and the family sits on it and consumes betel
          together as a sort of silent prayer or charm to ensure the growth
          of the crop. The rice that is planted round this spot is the last
          to be reaped at harvest. At the commencement of the reaping the
          stalks of this patch of rice are tied together into a sheaf, which
          is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mother of the Rice”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ineno pae</span></span>), and offerings in the
          shape of rice, fowl's liver, eggs, and other things are laid down
          before it. When all the rest of the rice in the field has been
          reaped, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mother of the Rice”</span> is
          cut down and carried with due honour to the rice-barn, where it is
          laid on the floor, and all the other sheaves are piled upon it. The
          Tomori, we are told, regard the Mother of the Rice as a special
          offering made to the rice-spirit Omonga, who dwells in the moon. If
          that spirit is not treated with proper respect, for example if the
          people who fetch rice from the barn are not decently clad, he is
          angry and punishes the offenders by eating up twice as much rice in
          the barn as they have taken out of it; some people have heard him
          smacking his lips in the barn, as he devoured the rice. On the
          other hand the Toradjas of Central Celebes, who also practise the
          custom of the Rice-mother at harvest, regard her as the actual
          mother of the whole harvest, and therefore keep her carefully, lest
          in her absence the garnered store of rice should all melt away and
          disappear.<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href=

          the Tomori, as among other Indonesian peoples, reapers at work in
          the field make use of special words which differ from the terms in
          ordinary use; the reason for adopting this peculiar form of speech
          at reaping appears to be, as I have already pointed out, a fear of
          alarming the timid soul of the rice by revealing the fate in store
          for it.<a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href=

          194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          motive is perhaps to be ascribed the practice observed by the

          Similarly among the Alfoors or Toradjas of Poso, in Central
          Celebes, while the people are watching the crops in the fields they
          amuse themselves with asking each other riddles and telling
          stories, and when any one guesses a riddle aright, the whole
          company cries out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let our rice come up,
          let fat ears come up both in the lowlands and on the
          heights.”</span> But all the time between harvest and the laying
          out of new fields the asking of riddles and the telling of stories
          is strictly forbidden.<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a> Thus
          among these people it seems that the asking of riddles is for some
          reason regarded as a charm which may make or mar the crops.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among some of
          the Toradjas of Celebes the ceremony of cutting and bringing home
          the Mother of the Rice is observed as follows. When the crop is
          ripe in the fields, the Mother of the Rice (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ânrong
          pâre</span></span>) must be fetched before the rest of the harvest
          is reaped. The ceremony is performed on a lucky day by a woman, who
          knows the rites. For three days previously she observes certain
          precautions to prevent the soul (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">soemangâna
          âse</span></span>) of the rice from escaping out of the field, as
          it might be apt to do, if it got wind that the reapers with their
          cruel knives were so soon to crop the ripe ears. With this view she
          ties up a handful of standing stalks of the rice into a bunch in
          each corner of the field, while she recites an invocation to the
          spirits of the rice, bidding them gather in the field from the four
          quarters of the heaven. As a further precaution she stops the
          sluices, lest with the outrush of the water from the rice-field the
          sly soul of the rice should make good its escape. And she ties
          knots in the leaves of the rice-plants, all to hinder the soul of
          the rice from running away. This she does in the afternoon of three
          successive days. On the morning of the fourth day she comes again
          to the field, sits down in a corner of it, and kisses the rice
          three times, again inviting the souls of the rice to come thither
          and assuring them of her affection and care. Then <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> she cuts the bunch of rice-stalks which
          she had tied together on one of the previous days. The stalks in
          the bunch must be nine in number, and their leaves must be cut with
          them, not thrown away. As she cuts, she may not look about her, nor
          cry out, nor speak to any one, nor be spoken to; but she says to
          the rice, <span class="tei tei-q">“The prophet reaps you. I take
          you, but you diminish not; I hold you in my hand and you increase.
          You are the links of my soul, the support of my body, my blessing,
          my salvation. There is no God but God.”</span> Then she passes to
          another corner of the field to cut the bunch of standing rice in it
          with the same ceremony; but before coming to it she stops half way
          to pluck another bunch of five stalks in like manner. Thus from the
          four sides of the field she collects in all fifty-six stalks of
          rice, which together make up the Mother of the Rice (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ânrong
          pâre</span></span>). Then in a corner of the field she makes a
          little stage and lays the Mother of the Rice on it, with the ears
          turned towards the standing rice and the cut stalks towards the
          dyke which encloses the field. After that she binds the fifty-six
          stalks of the Rice-mother into a sheaf with the bark of a
          particular kind of tree. As she does so, she says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The prophet binds you into a sheaf; the angel
          increases you; the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">awâlli</span></span> cares for you. We loved
          and cared for each other.”</span> Then, after anointing the sheaf
          and fumigating it with incense, she lays it on the little stage. On
          this stage she had previously placed several kinds of rice, betel,
          one or more eggs, sweetmeats, and young coco-nuts, all as offerings
          to the Mother of the Rice, who, if she did not receive these
          attentions, would be offended and visit people with sickness or
          even vanish away altogether. Sometimes on large farms a fowl is
          killed and its blood deposited in the half of a coco-nut on the
          stage. The standing rice round about the stage is the last of the
          whole field to be reaped. When it has been cut, it is bound up with
          the Mother of the Rice into a single sheaf and carried home. Any
          body may carry the sheaf, but in doing so he or she must take care
          not to let it fall, or the Rice-mother would be angry and might
          disappear.<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href=

          into a little sheaf. After that the reaping may begin, and while it
          is going forward offerings of rice and betel are presented in the
          middle of the field to the spirit of the rice, who is personified
          under the name of Miss Dajang. The offering is accompanied by a
          common meal shared by the reapers. When all the rice has been
          reaped, threshed and garnered, the little sheaf which was first cut
          is brought in and laid on the top of the heap in the granary,
          together with an egg or a stone, which is supposed to watch over

          Though we are not told, we may assume that the personified spirit
          of the rice is supposed to be present in the first sheaf cut and in
          that form to keep guard over the rice in the granary. Another
          writer, who has independently described the customs of the
          Karo-Bataks at the rice-harvest, tells us that the largest sheaf,
          which is usually the one first made up, is regarded as the seat of
          the rice-soul and is treated exactly like a person; at the
          trampling of the paddy to separate the grain from the husks the
          sheaf in question is specially entrusted to a girl who has a lucky
          name, and whose parents are both alive.<a id="noteref_602" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Mandeling, a
          district of Sumatra, contrary to what seems to be the usual
          practice, the spirit of the rice is personified as a male instead
          of as a female and is called the Rajah or King of the Rice. He is
          supposed to be immanent in certain rice-plants, which are
          recognised by their peculiar formation, such as a concealment of
          the ears in the sheath, an unusual arrangement of the leaves, or a
          stunted growth. When one or more such plants have been discovered
          in the field, they are sprinkled with lime-juice, and the spirits
          are invoked by name and informed that they are expected at home and
          that all is ready for their reception. Then the King of the Rice is
          plucked with the hand and seven neighbouring rice-stalks cut with a
          knife. He and his seven companions are then carefully brought home;
          the bearer may not speak a word, and the children in the house may
          make no noise till the King of the Rice has been safely lodged in
          the granary and tethered, for greater security, with a grass rope
          to one of the posts. As soon as that is done, the doors are shut to
          prevent the spirits of the rice from escaping. The person who
          fetches the King of the Rice from the field should prepare himself
          for the important duty by eating a hearty meal, for it would be an
          omen of a bad harvest if he presented himself before the King of
          the Rice with an empty stomach. For the same reason the sower of
          rice should sow the seed on a full stomach, in order that the ears

          clip seven stems to be the <span class="tei tei-q">‘soul of the
          rice’</span>; and then you clip yet another handful to be the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘mother-seed’</span> for the following
          year. The <span class="tei tei-q">‘soul’</span> is wrapped in a

          ceremony of cutting and bringing home the Soul of the Rice was
          witnessed by Mr. W. W. Skeat at Chodoi in Selangor on the
          twenty-eighth of January 1897. The particular bunch or sheaf which
          was to serve as the Mother of the Rice-soul had previously been
          sought and identified by means of the markings or shape of the
          ears. From this sheaf an aged sorceress, with much solemnity, cut a
          little bundle of seven ears, anointed them with oil, tied them
          round with parti-coloured thread, fumigated them with incense, and
          having wrapt them in a white cloth deposited them in a little
          oval-shaped basket. These seven ears were the infant Soul of the
          Rice and the little basket was its cradle. It was carried home to
          the farmer's house by another woman, who held up an umbrella to
          screen the tender infant from the hot rays of the sun. Arrived at
          the house the Rice-child was welcomed by the women of the family,
          and laid, cradle and all, on a new sleeping-mat with pillows at the
          head. After that the farmer's wife was instructed to observe
          certain rules of taboo for three days, the rules being in many
          respects identical with those which have to be observed for three
          days after the birth of a real child. For example, perfect quiet
          must be observed, as in a house where a baby has just been born; a
          light was placed near the head of the Rice-child's bed and might
          not go out at night, while the fire on the hearth had to be kept
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name=
          "Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> up both day and
          night till the three days were over; hair might not be cut; and
          money, rice, salt, oil, and so forth were forbidden to go out of
          the house, though of course these valuable articles were quite free
          to come in. Something of the same tender care which is thus
          bestowed on the newly-born Rice-child is naturally extended also to
          its parent, the sheaf from whose body it was taken. This sheaf,
          which remains standing in the field after the Rice-soul has been
          carried home and put to bed, is treated as a newly-made mother;
          that is to say, young shoots of trees are pounded together and
          scattered broadcast every evening for three successive days, and
          when the three days are up you take the pulp of a coco-nut and what
          are called <span class="tei tei-q">“goat-flowers,”</span> mix them
          up, eat them with a little sugar, and spit some of the mixture out
          among the rice. So after a real birth the young shoots of the
          jack-fruit, the rose-apple, certain kinds of banana, and the thin
          pulp of young coco-nuts are mixed with dried fish, salt, acid,
          prawn-condiment, and the like dainties to form a sort of salad,
          which is administered to mother and child for three successive
          days. The last sheaf is reaped by the farmer's wife, who carries it
          back to the house, where it is threshed and mixed with the
          Rice-soul. The farmer then takes the Rice-soul and its basket and
          deposits it, together with the product of the last sheaf, in the
          big circular rice-bin used by the Malays. Some grains from the
          Rice-soul are mixed with the seed which is to be sown in the
          following year.<a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href=

          its parallel in a ceremony observed at the rice-harvest in Java.
          Before the reapers begin to cut the rice, the priest or sorcerer
          picks out a number of ears of rice, which are tied together,
          smeared with ointment, and adorned with flowers. Thus decked out,
          the ears are called the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> afterwards. Later
          on, when the rice is being got in, a bridal chamber is partitioned
          off in the barn, and furnished with a new mat, a lamp, and all
          kinds of toilet articles. Sheaves of rice, to represent the wedding
          guests, are placed beside the Rice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom.
          Not till this has been done may the whole harvest be housed in the
          barn. And for the first forty days after the rice has been housed,

          of rice (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the bridal pair”</span> is received on a

          rice-plant as animated by a soul. They regard it as one with a
          divinity and treat it with the distinction and honour that are
          shewn to a very important person. But as it is impossible to treat
          all the rice-stalks in a field ceremoniously, the native, feeling
          the need of a visible and tangible representative of the rice-deity
          and taking a part for the whole, picks out some stalks and
          conceives them as the visible abode of the rice-soul, to which he
          can pay his homage and from which he hopes to derive advantage.
          These few stalks, the foremost among their many peers, form what is
          called the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ninin pantun</span></span> by the people of
          Bali and the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          of Lombok.<a id="noteref_609" name="noteref_609" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a> The
          name <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ina paré</span></span> is sometimes translated
          Rice-mother, but the more correct translation is said to be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the principal rice.”</span> The stalks of
          which this <span class="tei tei-q">“principal rice”</span> consists
          are the first nine shoots which the husbandman himself takes with
          his own hands from the nursery or bedding-out ground and plants at
          the upper end of the rice-field beside the inlet of the irrigation
          water. They are planted with great care in a definite order, one of
          them in the middle and the other eight in a circle about it. When
          the whole field has been planted, an offering, which usually
          consists of rice in many forms, is made to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the principal rice”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">inan
          paré</span></span>). When the rice-stalks begin to swell the rice
          is said to be pregnant, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“principal
          rice”</span> is treated with the delicate attentions which are paid
          to a woman with child. Thus rice-pap and eggs are laid down beside
          it, and sour fruits are often presented to it, because pregnant
          women are believed to long for sour fruit. Moreover <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the fertilisation of the rice by the
          irrigation water is compared to the union of the goddess Batari Sri
          with her husband Ida Batara (Vishnu), who is identified with the
          flowing water. Some people sprinkle the pregnant rice with water in
          which cooling drugs have been infused or with water which has stood
          on a holy grave, in order that the ears may fill out well. When the
          time of harvest has come, the owner of the field himself makes a
          beginning by cutting <span class="tei tei-q">“the principal
          rice”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inan paré</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ninin
          pantun</span></span>) with his own hands and binding it into two
          sheaves, each composed of one hundred and eight stalks with their
          leaves attached to them. One of the sheaves represents a man and
          the other a woman, and they are called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“husband and wife”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">istri
          kakung</span></span>). The male sheaf is wound about with thread so
          that none of the leaves are visible, whereas the female sheaf has
          its leaves bent over and tied so as to resemble the roll of a
          woman's hair. Sometimes, for further distinction, a necklace of
          rice-straw is tied round the female sheaf. The two sheaves are then
          fastened together and tied to a branch of a tree, which is stuck in
          the ground at the inlet of the irrigation water. There they remain
          while all the rest of the rice is being reaped. Sometimes, instead
          of being tied to a bough, they are laid on a little bamboo altar.
          The reapers at their work take great care to let no grains of rice
          fall on the ground, otherwise the Rice-goddess would grieve and
          weep at being parted from her sisters, who are carried to the barn.
          If any portion of the field remains unreaped at nightfall, the
          reapers make loops in the leaves of some of the standing stalks to
          prevent the evil spirits from proceeding with the harvest during
          the hours of darkness, or, according to another account, lest the
          Rice-goddess should go astray. When the rice is brought home from
          the field, the two sheaves representing the husband and wife are
          carried by a woman on her head, and are the last of all to be
          deposited in the barn. There they are laid to rest on a small
          erection or on a cushion of rice-straw along with three lumps of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nasi</span></span>, which are regarded as the
          attendants or watchers of the bridal pair. The whole arrangement,
          we are informed, has for its object to induce the rice to increase
          and multiply in the granary, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> so that the owner may get more out of it than
          he put in. Hence when the people of Bali bring the two sheaves, the
          husband and wife, into the barn, they say <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Increase ye and multiply without ceasing.”</span> When
          a woman fetches rice from the granary for the use of her household,
          she has to observe a number of rules, all of which are clearly
          dictated by respect for the spirit of the rice. She should not
          enter the barn in the dark or at noon perhaps because the spirit
          may then be supposed to be sleeping. She must enter with her right
          foot first. She must be decently clad with her breasts covered. She
          must not chew betel, and she would do well to rinse her mouth
          before repairing to the barn, just as she would do if she waited on
          a person of distinction or on a divinity. No sick or menstruous
          woman may enter the barn, and there must be no talking in it, just
          as there must be no talking when shelled rice is being scooped up.
          When all the rice in the barn has been used up, the two sheaves
          representing the husband and wife remain in the empty building till
          they have gradually disappeared or been devoured by mice. The pinch
          of hunger sometimes drives individuals to eat up the rice of these
          two sheaves, but the wretches who do so are viewed with disgust by
          their fellows and branded as pigs and dogs. Nobody would ever sell
          these holy sheaves with the rest of their profane brethren.<a id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the theory
          which recognises in the European Corn-mother, Corn-maiden, and so
          forth, the embodiment in vegetable form of the animating spirit of
          the crops is amply confirmed by the evidence of peoples in other
          parts of the world, who, because they have lagged behind the
          European races in mental development, retain for that very reason a
          keener sense of the original motives for observing those rustic
          rites which among ourselves have sunk to the level of meaningless
          survivals. The reader may, however, remember that according to
          Mannhardt, whose theory I am expounding, the spirit of the corn
          manifests itself not merely in vegetable but also in human form;
          the person who cuts the last sheaf or gives the last stroke at
          threshing passes for a temporary embodiment of the corn-spirit,
          just as much as the bunch of corn which he reaps or threshes. Now
          in the parallels which have been hitherto adduced from the customs
          of peoples outside Europe the spirit of the crops appears only in
          vegetable form. It remains, therefore, to prove that other races
          besides our European peasantry have conceived the spirit of the
          crops as incorporate in or represented by living men and women.
          Such a proof, I may remind the reader, is germane to the theme of
          this book; for the more instances we discover of human beings
          representing in themselves the life or animating spirit of plants,
          the less difficulty will be felt at classing amongst them the King
          of the Wood at Nemi.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mandans and
          Minnitarees of North America used to hold a festival in spring
          which they called the corn-medicine festival of the women. They
          thought that a certain Old Woman who Never Dies made the crops to
          grow, and that, living somewhere in the south, she sent the
          migratory waterfowl in spring as her tokens and representatives.
          Each sort of bird represented a special kind of crop cultivated by
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name=
          "Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Indians: the
          wild goose stood for the maize, the wild swan for the gourds, and
          the wild duck for the beans. So when the feathered messengers of
          the Old Woman began to arrive in spring the Indians celebrated the
          corn-medicine festival of the women. Scaffolds were set up, on
          which the people hung dried meat and other things by way of
          offerings to the Old Woman; and on a certain day the old women of
          the tribe, as representatives of the Old Woman who Never Dies,
          assembled at the scaffolds each bearing in her hand an ear of maize
          fastened to a stick. They first planted these sticks in the ground,
          then danced round the scaffolds, and finally took up the sticks
          again in their arms. Meanwhile old men beat drums and shook rattles
          as a musical accompaniment to the performance of the old women.
          Further, young women came and put dried flesh into the mouths of
          the old women, for which they received in return a grain of the
          consecrated maize to eat. Three or four grains of the holy corn
          were also placed in the dishes of the young women, to be afterwards
          carefully mixed with the seed-corn, which they were supposed to
          fertilise. The dried flesh hung on the scaffold belonged to the old
          women, because they represented the Old Woman who Never Dies. A
          similar corn-medicine festival was held in autumn for the purpose
          of attracting the herds of buffaloes and securing a supply of meat.
          At that time every woman carried in her arms an uprooted plant of
          maize. They gave the name of the Old Woman who Never Dies both to
          the maize and to those birds which they regarded as symbols of the
          fruits of the earth, and they prayed to them in autumn saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother, have pity on us! send us not the
          bitter cold too soon, lest we have not meat enough! let not all the
          game depart, that we may have something for the winter!”</span> In
          autumn, when the birds were flying south, the Indians thought that
          they were going home to the Old Woman and taking to her the
          offerings that had been hung up on the scaffolds, especially the
          dried meat, which she ate.<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612"

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Miamis,
          another tribe of North American Indians, tell a tale in which the
          spirit of the corn figures as a broken-down old man. They say that
          corn, that is, maize, first grew in heaven, and that the Good
          Spirit commanded it to go down and dwell with men on earth. At
          first it was reluctant to do so, but the Good Spirit prevailed on
          it to go by promising that men would treat it well in return for
          the benefit they derived from it. <span class="tei tei-q">“So corn
          came down from heaven to benefit the Indian, and this is the reason
          why they esteem it, and are bound to take good care of it, and to
          nurture it, and not raise more than they actually require, for
          their own consumption.”</span> But once a whole town of the Miamis
          was severely punished for failing in respect for the corn. They had
          raised a great crop and stored much of it under ground, and much of
          it they packed for immediate use in bags. But the corn was so
          plentiful that much of it still remained on the stalks, and the
          young men grew reckless and played with the shelled cobs, throwing
          them at each other, and at last they even broke the cobs from the
          growing stalks and pelted each other with them too. But a judgment
          soon followed on such wicked conduct. For when the hunters went out
          to hunt, though the deer seemed to abound, they could kill nothing.
          So the corn was gone and they could get no meat, and the people
          were hungry. Well, one of the hunters, roaming by himself in the
          woods to find something to eat for his aged father, came upon a
          small lodge in the wilderness where a decrepit old man was lying
          with his back to the fire. Now the old man was no other than the
          Spirit of the Corn. He said to the young hunter, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My grandson, the Indians have afflicted me much, and
          reduced me to the sad state in which you see me. In the side of the
          lodge you will find a small kettle. Take it and eat, and when you
          have satisfied your hunger, I will speak to you.”</span> But the
          kettle was full of such fine sweet corn as the hunter had never in
          his life seen before. When he had eaten his fill, the old man
          resumed the thread of his discourse, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Your people have wantonly abused and reduced me to the
          state you now see me in: my back-bone <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is broken in many places; it was the foolish
          young men of your town who did me this evil, for I am Mondamin, or
          corn, that came down from heaven. In their play they threw
          corn-cobs and corn-ears at one another, treating me with contempt.
          I am the corn-spirit whom they have injured. That is why you
          experience bad luck and famine. I am the cause; you feel my just
          resentment, therefore your people are punished. Other Indians do
          not treat me so. They respect me, and so it is well with them. Had
          you no elders to check the youths at their wanton sport? You are an
          eye-witness of my sufferings. They are the effect of what you did
          to my body.”</span> With that he groaned and covered himself up. So
          the young hunter returned and reported what he had seen and heard;
          and since then the Indians have been very careful not to play with
          corn in the ear.<a id="noteref_613" name="noteref_613" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Compared with
          the Corn-mother of Germany and the Harvest-maiden of Scotland, the
          Demeter and Persephone of Greece are late products of religious
          growth. Yet as members of the Aryan family the Greeks must at one
          time or another have observed harvest customs like those which are
          still practised by Celts, Teutons, and Slavs, and which, far beyond
          the limits of the Aryan world, have been practised by the Indians
          of Peru, the Dyaks of Borneo, and many other natives of the East
          Indies—a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg
          208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          sufficient proof that the ideas on which these customs rest are not
          confined to any one race, but naturally suggest themselves to all
          untutored peoples engaged in agriculture. It is probable,
          therefore, that Demeter and Persephone, those stately and beautiful
          figures of Greek mythology, grew out of the same simple beliefs and
          practices which still prevail among our modern peasantry, and that
          they were represented by rude dolls made out of the yellow sheaves
          on many a harvest-field long before their breathing images were
          wrought in bronze and marble by the master hands of Phidias and
          Praxiteles. A reminiscence of that olden time—a scent, so to say,
          of the harvest-field—lingered to the last in the title of the
          Maiden (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kore</span></span>) by which Persephone was
          commonly known. Thus if the prototype of Demeter is the Corn-mother
          of Germany, the prototype of Persephone is the Harvest-maiden,
          which, autumn after autumn, is still made from the last sheaf on
          the Braes of Balquhidder. Indeed, if we knew more about the
          peasant-farmers of ancient Greece, we should probably find that
          even in classical times they continued annually to fashion their
          Corn-mothers (Demeters) and Maidens (Persephones) out of the ripe
          corn on the harvest-fields.<a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a> But
          unfortunately the Demeter and Persephone whom we know were the
          denizens of towns, the majestic inhabitants of lordly temples; it
          was for such divinities alone that the refined writers of antiquity
          had eyes; the uncouth rites performed by rustics amongst the corn
          were beneath their notice. Even if they noticed them, they probably
          never dreamed of any connexion between the puppet of corn-stalks on
          the sunny stubble-field and the marble divinity in the shady
          coolness of the temple. Still the writings even of these town-bred
          and cultured persons afford us an occasional glimpse of a Demeter
          as rude as the rudest that a remote German village can shew. Thus

          Again, in the Prussian custom just referred to, the woman who plays
          the part of Corn-mother represents the ripe grain; the child
          appears to represent next year's corn, which may be regarded,
          naturally enough, as the child of this year's corn, since it is
          from the seed of this year's harvest that next year's crop will
          spring. Further, we have seen that among the Malays of the
          Peninsula <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
          210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and sometimes among the Highlanders of Scotland the spirit of the
          grain is represented in double female form, both as old and young,
          by means of ears taken alike from the ripe crop: in Scotland the
          old spirit of the corn appears as the Carline or <span lang="gd"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="gd"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cailleach</span></span>, the young spirit as
          the Maiden; while among the Malays of the Peninsula the two spirits
          of the rice are definitely related to each other as mother and
          child.<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href=

          Judged by these analogies Demeter would be the ripe crop of this
          year; Persephone would be the seed-corn taken from it and sown in
          autumn, to reappear in spring.<a id="noteref_622" name=
          "noteref_622" href="#note_622"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> The
          descent of Persephone into the lower world would thus be a mythical
          expression for the sowing of the seed; her reappearance in spring
          would signify the sprouting of the young corn. In this way the
          Persephone of one year becomes the Demeter of the next, and this
          may very well have been the original form of the myth. But when
          with the advance of religious thought the corn came to be
          personified, no longer as a being that went through the whole cycle
          of birth, growth, reproduction, and death within a year, but as an
          immortal goddess, consistency required that one of the two
          personifications, the mother or the daughter, should be sacrificed.
          However, the double conception of the corn as mother and daughter
          may have been too old and too deeply rooted in the popular mind to
          be eradicated by logic, and so room had to be found in the reformed
          myth both for mother and daughter. This was done by assigning to
          Persephone the character of the corn sown in autumn and sprouting
          in spring, while Demeter was left to play the somewhat vague part
          of the heavy mother of the corn, who laments its annual
          disappearance underground, and rejoices over its reappearance in
          spring. Thus instead of a regular succession of divine beings, each
          living a year and then giving birth to her successor, the reformed
          myth exhibits the conception of two divine and immortal beings, one
          of whom annually disappears into and reappears from the ground,
          while the other has little to do but to weep and rejoice at the
          appropriate seasons.<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623" href=

              with the personification of the corn as a single goddess, and
              the conception of a second goddess may have been a later
              development. Duplication of deities as a consequence of the
              anthropomorphic tendency. Example of such duplication in Japan,
              where there are two distinct deities of the sun. Perhaps the
              Greek personification of the corn as a mother and a daughter
              (Demeter and Persephone) is a case of such a mythical
              duplication.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This theory of
          the double personification of the corn in Greek myth assumes that
          both personifications (Demeter and Persephone) are original. But if
          we suppose that the Greek myth started with a single
          personification, the after-growth of a second personification may
          perhaps be explained as follows. On looking over the harvest
          customs which have been passed under review, it may be noticed that
          they involve two distinct conceptions of the corn-spirit. For
          whereas in some of the customs the corn-spirit is treated as
          immanent in the corn, in others it is regarded as external to it.
          Thus when a particular sheaf is called by the name of the
          corn-spirit, and is dressed in clothes and handled with
          reverence,<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href=
          "#note_624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a> the
          spirit is clearly regarded as immanent in the corn. But when the
          spirit is said to make the crops grow by passing through them, or
          to blight the grain of those against whom she has a grudge,<a id=
          "noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href="#note_625"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">625</span></span></a> she
          is apparently conceived as distinct from, though exercising power
          over, the corn. Conceived in the latter way the corn-spirit is in a
          fair way to become a deity of the corn, if she has not become so
          already. Of these two conceptions, that of the corn-spirit as
          immanent in the corn is doubtless the older, since the view of
          nature as animated by indwelling spirits appears to have generally
          preceded the view of it as controlled by external deities; to put
          it shortly, animism precedes deism. In the harvest customs of our
          European peasantry the corn-spirit seems to be conceived now as
          immanent in the corn and now as external to it. In Greek mythology,
          on the other hand, Demeter is viewed rather as the deity of the
          corn than as the spirit immanent in it.<a id="noteref_626" name=

          process of thought which leads <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to the change from the one mode of conception
          to the other is anthropomorphism, or the gradual investment of the
          immanent spirits with more and more of the attributes of humanity.
          As men emerge from savagery the tendency to humanise their
          divinities gains strength; and the more human these become the
          wider is the breach which severs them from the natural objects of
          which they were at first merely the animating spirits or souls. But
          in the progress upwards from savagery men of the same generation do
          not march abreast; and though the new anthropomorphic gods may
          satisfy the religious wants of the more developed intelligences,
          the backward members of the community will cling by preference to
          the old animistic notions. Now when the spirit of any natural
          object such as the corn has been invested with human qualities,
          detached from the object, and converted into a deity controlling
          it, the object itself is, by the withdrawal of its spirit, left
          inanimate; it becomes, so to say, a spiritual vacuum. But the
          popular fancy, intolerant of such a vacuum, in other words, unable
          to conceive anything as inanimate, immediately creates a fresh
          mythical being, with which it peoples the vacant object. Thus the
          same natural object comes to be represented in mythology by two
          distinct beings: first by the old spirit now separated from it and
          raised to the rank of a deity; second, by the new spirit, freshly
          created by the popular fancy to supply the place vacated by the old
          spirit on its elevation to a higher sphere. For example, in
          Japanese religion the solar character of Ama-terasu, the great
          goddess of the Sun, has become obscured, and accordingly the people
          have personified the sun afresh under the name of <span lang="ja"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nichi-rin sama</span></span>, <span class=

          "tei tei-q">“august-heaven-path-personage”</span>; to the lower
          class of Japanese at the present day, especially to women and
          children, <span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "ja"><span style="font-style: italic">O tentō sama</span></span> is
          the actual sun, sexless, mythless, and unencumbered by any formal
          worship, yet looked up to as a moral being who rewards the good,
          punishes the wicked, and enforces oaths made in his name.<a id=
          "noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href="#note_627"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">627</span></span></a> In
          such cases the problem for mythology is, having got two distinct
          personifications of the same object, what to do with them? How are
          their relations to each other <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to be adjusted, and room found for both in
          the mythological system? When the old spirit or new deity is
          conceived as creating or producing the object in question, the
          problem is easily solved. Since the object is believed to be
          produced by the old spirit, and animated by the new one, the
          latter, as the soul of the object, must also owe its existence to
          the former; thus the old spirit will stand to the new one as
          producer to produced, that is, in mythology, as parent to child,
          and if both spirits are conceived as female, their relation will be
          that of mother and daughter. In this way, starting from a single
          personification of the corn as female, mythic fancy might in time
          reach a double personification of it as mother and daughter. It
          would be very rash to affirm that this was the way in which the
          myth of Demeter and Persephone actually took shape; but it seems a
          legitimate conjecture that the reduplication of deities, of which
          Demeter and Persephone furnish an example, may sometimes have
          arisen in the way indicated. For example, among the pairs of
          deities dealt with in a former part of this work, it has been shewn
          that there are grounds for regarding both Isis and her companion
          god Osiris as personifications of the corn.<a id="noteref_628"
          name="noteref_628" href="#note_628"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">628</span></span></a> On
          the hypothesis just suggested, Isis would be the old corn-spirit,
          and Osiris would be the newer one, whose relationship to the old
          spirit was variously explained as that of brother, husband, and
          son;<a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629" href=
          "#note_629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">629</span></span></a> for
          of course mythology would always be free to account for the
          coexistence of the two divinities in more ways than one. It must
          not, however, be forgotten that this proposed explanation of such

          complete the resemblance. A leading incident in the Greek myth is
          the death and resurrection of Persephone; it is this incident
          which, coupled with the nature of the goddess as a deity of
          vegetation, links the myth with the cults of Adonis, Attis, Osiris,
          and Dionysus; and it is in virtue of this incident that the myth
          finds a place in our discussion of the Dying God. It remains,
          therefore, to see whether the conception of the annual death and
          resurrection of a god, which figures so prominently in these great
          Greek and Oriental worships, has not also its origin or its analogy
          in the rustic rites observed by reapers and vine-dressers amongst

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          already mentioned, on the authority of Diodorus, that in ancient
          Egypt the reapers were wont to lament over the first sheaf cut,
          invoking Isis as the goddess to whom they owed the discovery of
          corn.<a id="noteref_630" name="noteref_630" href=

          the plaintive song or cry sung or uttered by Egyptian reapers the
          Greeks gave the name of Maneros, and explained the name by a story
          that Maneros, the only son of the first Egyptian king, invented
          agriculture, and, dying an untimely death, was thus lamented by the
          people.<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">631</span></span></a> It
          appears, however, that the name Maneros is due to a
          misunderstanding of the formula <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mââ-ne-hra</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come to the house,”</span> which has been discovered

          reapers over the cut corn as a dirge for the death of the
          corn-spirit (Isis or Osiris) and a prayer for its return. As the
          cry was raised over the first ears reaped, it would seem that the
          corn-spirit was believed by the Egyptians to be present in the
          first corn cut and to die under the sickle. We have seen that in
          the Malay Peninsula and Java the first ears of rice are taken to
          represent either the Soul of the Rice or the Rice-bride and the
          Rice-bridegroom.<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href=

          that the last sheaf is treated elsewhere. It is reaped by the
          mistress herself, taken home and set in the place of honour near
          the holy pictures; afterwards it is threshed separately, and some

          bastard son of Midas, King of Phrygia, and dwelt at Celaenae. He
          used to reap the corn, and had an enormous appetite. When a
          stranger happened to enter the corn-field or to pass by it,
          Lityerses gave him plenty to eat and drink, then took him to the
          corn-fields on the banks of the Maeander and compelled him to reap
          along with him. Lastly, it was his custom to wrap the stranger in a
          sheaf, cut off his head with a sickle, and carry away his body,
          swathed in the corn stalks. But at last Hercules undertook to reap
          with him, cut off his head with the sickle, and threw his body into

          Lityerses slew others (as Theseus treated Sinis and Sciron), we may
          infer that Lityerses used to throw the bodies of his victims into
          the river. According to another version of the story, Lityerses, a
          son of Midas, was wont to challenge people to a reaping match with
          him, and if he vanquished them he used to thrash them; but one day

          the description of a Phrygian harvest custom in accordance with
          which certain persons, especially strangers passing the harvest
          field, were regularly regarded as embodiments of the corn-spirit,
          and as such were seized by the reapers, wrapt in sheaves, and
          beheaded, their bodies, bound up in the corn-stalks, being
          afterwards thrown into water as a rain-charm. The grounds for this
          supposition are, first, the resemblance of the Lityerses story to
          the harvest customs of European peasantry, and, second, the
          frequency of human sacrifices offered by savage races to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I. In regard to
          the first head, we have seen that in modern Europe the person who
          cuts or binds or threshes the last sheaf is often exposed to rough
          treatment at the hands of his fellow-labourers. For example, he is
          bound up in the last sheaf, and, thus encased, is carried or carted
          about, beaten, drenched with water, thrown on a dunghill, and so
          forth. Or, if he is spared this horseplay, he is at least the
          subject of ridicule or is thought to be destined to suffer some
          misfortune in the course of the year. Hence the harvesters are
          naturally reluctant to give the last cut at reaping or the last
          stroke at threshing or to bind the last sheaf, and towards the
          close of the work this reluctance produces an emulation among the
          labourers, each striving to finish his task as fast as possible, in
          order that he may escape the invidious distinction of being
          last.<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href=

          example, in the neighbourhood of Danzig, when the winter corn is
          cut and mostly bound up in sheaves, the portion which still remains
          to be bound is divided amongst the women binders, each of whom
          receives a swath of equal length to bind. A crowd of reapers,

          the word, <span class="tei tei-q">“Seize the Old Man,”</span> the
          women fall to work, all binding their allotted swaths as hard as
          they can. The spectators watch them narrowly, and the woman who
          cannot keep pace with the rest and consequently binds the last
          sheaf has to carry <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg
          219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Old Man (that is, the last sheaf made up in the form of a man)
          to the farmhouse and deliver it to the farmer with the words,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Here I bring you the Old Man.”</span> At
          the supper which follows, the Old Man is placed at the table and
          receives an abundant portion of food, which, as he cannot eat it,
          falls to the share of the woman who carried him. Afterwards the Old
          Man is placed in the yard and all the people dance round him. Or
          the woman who bound the last sheaf dances for a good while with the
          Old Man, while the rest form a ring round them; afterwards they
          all, one after the other, dance a single round with him. Further,
          the woman who bound the last sheaf goes herself by the name of the
          Old Man till the next harvest, and is often mocked with the cry,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Here comes the Old Man.”</span><a id=

          the Mittelmark district of Prussia, when the rye has been reaped,
          and the last sheaves are about to be tied up, the binders stand in
          two rows facing each other, every woman with her sheaf and her
          straw rope before her. At a given signal they all tie up their
          sheaves, and the one who is the last to finish is ridiculed by the
          rest. Not only so, but her sheaf is made up into human shape and
          called the Old Man, and she must carry it home to the farmyard,
          where the harvesters dance in a circle round her and it. Then they
          take the Old Man to the farmer and deliver it to him with the
          words, <span class="tei tei-q">“We bring the Old Man to the Master.
          He may keep him till he gets a new one.”</span> After that the Old
          Man is set up against a tree, where he remains for a long time, the
          butt of many jests.<a id="noteref_647" name="noteref_647" href=

          Aschbach in Bavaria, when the reaping is nearly finished, the
          reapers say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, we will drive out the
          Old Man.”</span> Each of them sets himself to reap a patch of corn
          as fast as he can; he who cuts the last handful or the last stalk
          is greeted by the rest with an exulting cry, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You have the Old Man.”</span> Sometimes a black mask
          is fastened on the reaper's face and he is dressed in woman's
          clothes; or if the reaper is a woman, she is dressed in man's
          clothes. A dance follows. At the supper the Old Man gets twice as
          large a portion of food as the others. The proceedings are similar
          at threshing; the person who gives the last stroke is <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> said to have the Old Man. At the supper
          given to the threshers he has to eat out of the cream-ladle and to
          drink a great deal. Moreover, he is quizzed and teased in all sorts
          of ways till he frees himself from further annoyance by treating
          the others to brandy or beer.<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648"

          to finish his work last. It will be remembered that the person who

          this idea is more fully expressed by binding him or her in
          corn-stalks. The latter custom has been already illustrated, but a
          few more instances may be added. At Kloxin, near Stettin, the
          harvesters call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You have the Old Man, and must keep
          him.”</span> The Old Man is a great bundle of corn decked with
          flowers and ribbons, and fashioned into a rude semblance of the
          human form. It is fastened on a rake or strapped on a horse, and
          brought with music to the village. In delivering the Old Man to the

          with flowers, and flowers and a helmet of straw are placed on her
          head. In solemn procession she carries the harvest-crown to the
          squire, over whose head she holds it while she utters a string of
          good wishes. At the dance which follows, the Old Man has the right

          their religious persuasion. A sheaf is made out of this corn, tied
          to a bamboo, set up in the last harvest cart, and carried home in
          triumph. Here it is fastened up in the threshing-floor or attached

          Ragnit, in Lithuania, the last handful of corn is left standing by
          itself, with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Old Woman

          there.”</span> Then a young reaper whets his scythe, and, with a
          strong sweep, cuts down the handful. It is now said of him that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he has cut off the Boba's head”</span>;
          and he receives a gratuity from the farmer and a jugful of water

          According to another account, every Lithuanian reaper makes haste
          to finish his task; for the Old Rye-woman lives in the last stalks,
          and whoever cuts the last stalks kills the Old Rye-woman, and by
          killing her he brings trouble on himself.<a id="noteref_668" name=

          Lithuania, again, the corn-spirit is believed to be killed at
          threshing as well as at reaping. When only a single pile of corn
          remains to be threshed, all the threshers suddenly step back a few
          paces, as if at the word of command. Then they fall to work, plying
          their flails with the utmost rapidity and vehemence, till they come
          to the last bundle. Upon this they fling themselves with almost
          frantic fury, straining every nerve, and raining blows on it till
          the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Halt!”</span> rings out

          leader. The man whose flail is the last to fall after the command
          to stop has been given is immediately surrounded by all the rest,
          crying out that <span class="tei tei-q">“he has struck the Old
          Rye-woman dead.”</span> He has to expiate the deed by treating them
          to brandy; and, like the man who cuts the last corn, he is known as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the killer of the Old

          Sometimes in Lithuania the slain corn-spirit was represented by a
          puppet. Thus a female figure was made out of corn-stalks, dressed
          in clothes, and placed on the threshing-floor, under the heap of
          corn which was to be threshed last. Whoever thereafter gave the
          last stroke at threshing <span class="tei tei-q">“struck the Old

          "tei tei-q">“burning the Old Witch”</span> is observed on the last
          day of harvest. A small sheaf of corn is burnt on the field in a
          fire of stubble; peas are parched at the fire and eaten with a
          liberal allowance of ale; and the lads and lasses romp about the
          flames and amuse themselves by blackening each other's faces.<a id=

          Sometimes, again, the corn-spirit is represented by a man, who lies
          down under the last corn; it is threshed upon his body, and the
          people say that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Old Man is being

          saw that sometimes the farmer's wife is thrust, together with the
          last sheaf, under the threshing-machine, as if to thresh her, and
          that afterwards a pretence is made of winnowing her.<a id=

          the man who gives the last stroke at threshing, and he is throttled
          with a straw garland. If he is tall, it is believed that the corn
          will be tall next year. Then he is tied on a bundle and flung into

          the representatives of the corn-spirit have generally been the man
          or woman who cuts, binds, or threshes the last corn. We now come to
          the cases in which the corn-spirit is represented either by a
          stranger passing the harvest-field (as in the Lityerses tale), or
          by a visitor entering it for the first time. All over Germany it is
          customary for the reapers or threshers to lay hold of passing
          strangers and bind them with a rope made of corn-stalks, till they
          pay a forfeit; and when the farmer himself or one of his guests
          enters the field or the threshing-floor for the first time, he is
          treated in the same way. Sometimes the rope is only tied round his
          arm or his feet or his neck.<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679"

          sometimes he is regularly swathed in corn. Thus at Solör in Norway,
          whoever enters the field, be he the master or a stranger, is tied
          up in a sheaf and must pay a ransom. In the neighbourhood of Soest,
          when the farmer visits the flax-pullers for the first time, he is
          completely enveloped in flax. Passers-by are also surrounded by the
          women, tied up in flax, and compelled to stand brandy.<a id=

          even a stranger enters the harvest-field for the first time after
          the reaping has begun, the wife of the chief reaper ties a rope
          twisted of corn-ears, or a nosegay made of corn-ears and flowers,
          to his arm, and he is obliged to ransom himself by the payment of a
          fine.<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href=

          the canton of Putanges, in Normandy, a pretence of tying up the
          owner of the land in the last sheaf of wheat is still practised, or
          at least was still practised some quarter of a century ago. The
          task falls to the women alone. They throw themselves on the
          proprietor, seize him by the arms, the legs, and the body, throw
          him to the ground, and stretch him on the last sheaf. Then a show
          is made of binding him, and the conditions to be observed at the
          harvest-supper are dictated to him. When he has accepted them, he
          is released and allowed to get up.<a id="noteref_684" name=

          Brie, Isle de France, when any one who does not belong to the farm
          passes by the harvest-field, the reapers give chase. If they catch
          him, they bind him in a sheaf and bite him, one after the other, in
          the forehead, crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“You shall carry the
          key of the field.”</span><a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685"
          href="#note_685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“To have the key”</span> is an expression
          used by harvesters elsewhere in the sense of to cut or bind or
          thresh the last sheaf;<a id="noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href=
          "#note_686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a>
          hence, it is equivalent to the phrases <span class="tei tei-q">“You
          have the Old Man,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You are the Old
          Man,”</span> which are addressed to the cutter, binder, or thresher
          of the last sheaf. Therefore, when a stranger, as at Brie, is tied
          up in a sheaf and told that he will <span class="tei tei-q">“carry
          the key of the field,”</span> it is as much as to say that he is
          the Old Man, that is, an embodiment of the corn-spirit. In
          hop-picking, if a well-dressed stranger passes the hop-yard, he is
          seized by the women, tumbled into the bin, covered with leaves, and
          not released till he has paid a fine.<a id="noteref_687" name=

          particularly in the counties of Fife and Kinross, down to recent
          times the reapers used to seize and dump, as it was called, any
          stranger who happened to visit or pass by the harvest field. The
          custom was to lay hold of the stranger by his ankles and armpits,
          lift him up, and bring the lower part of his person into violent
          contact with the ground. Women as well as men were liable to be
          thus treated. The practice of interposing a sheaf between the
          sufferer and the ground is said to be a modern refinement.<a id=

          Comparing this custom with the one practised at Putanges in
          Normandy, which has just been described, we may conjecture that in
          Scotland the <span class="tei tei-q">“dumping”</span> of strangers
          on the harvest-field was originally a preliminary to wrapping them
          up in sheaves of corn.</p>

          finished, the workers seize the master of the field, and, tying his
          arms crosswise behind him, load all the implements, that is to say,
          the hoes, upon his back, fastening them with ropes. Then they form
          two single columns, the landlord in the middle between them, and
          all facing the house. Thus they start homeward. Simultaneously the
          two men at the heads of the columns begin to run rapidly forward
          some thirty yards, cross each other, then turn back, run along the
          two columns, cross each other again at the rear and take their
          places each at the end of his row. As they pass each other ahead
          and in the rear of the columns they beat their mouths with the
          hollow of their hands and yell. As soon as they reach their places
          at the foot, the next pair in front of the columns starts off,
          running in the same way, and thus pair after pair performs the
          tour, the procession all the time advancing toward the house. A
          short distance in front of it they come to a halt, and are met by
          two young men who carry red handkerchiefs tied to sticks like
          flags. The father of the family, still tied up and loaded with the
          hoes, steps forward alone and kneels down in front of his
          house-door. The flag-bearers wave their banners over him, and the
          women of the household come out and kneel on <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> their left knees, first toward the
          east, and after a little while toward each of the other cardinal
          points, west, south, and north. In conclusion the flags are waved
          in front of the house. The father then rises and the people untie
          him, whereupon he first salutes the women with the usual greeting,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          into the house, and the man makes a short speech thanking them all
          for the assistance they have given him, for how could he have
          gotten through his work without them? They have provided him with a
          year's life (that is, with the wherewithal to sustain it), and now
          he is going to give them tesvino. He gives a drinking-gourd full to
          each one in the assembly, and appoints one man among them to
          distribute more to all. The same ceremony is performed after the
          ploughing and after the harvesting. On the first occasion the tied
          man may be made to carry the yoke of the oxen, on the second he
          does not carry anything.”</span><a id="noteref_689" name=

          meaning of these Mexican ceremonies is not clear. Perhaps the
          custom of tying up the farmer at hoeing, ploughing, and reaping is
          a form of expiation or apology offered to the spirits of the earth,

          However, this explanation of the Mexican ceremonies at hoeing,
          ploughing, and reaping is purely conjectural. In these ceremonies
          there is no evidence that, as in the parallel European customs, the
          farmer is identified <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg
          229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          with the corn-spirit, since he is not wrapt up in the sheaves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Be that as it
          may, the evidence adduced above suffices to prove that, like the
          ancient Lityerses, modern European reapers have been wont to lay
          hold of a passing stranger and tie him up in a sheaf. It is not to
          be expected that they should complete the parallel by cutting off
          his head; but if they do not take such a strong step, their
          language and gestures are at least indicative of a desire to do so.
          For instance, in Mecklenburg on the first day of reaping, if the
          master or mistress or a stranger enters the field, or merely passes
          by it, all the mowers face towards him and sharpen their scythes,
          clashing their whet-stones against them in unison, as if they were
          making ready to mow. Then the woman who leads the mowers steps up
          to him and ties a band round his left arm. He must ransom himself
          by payment of a forfeit.<a id="noteref_693" name="noteref_693"
          href="#note_693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a> Near
          Ratzeburg, when the master or other person of mark enters the field
          or passes by it, all the harvesters stop work and march towards him
          in a body, the men with their scythes in front. On meeting him they
          form up in line, men and women. The men stick the poles of their
          scythes in the ground, as they do in whetting them; then they take
          off their caps and hang them on the scythes, while their leader
          stands forward and makes a speech. When he has done, they all whet
          their scythes in measured time very loudly, after which they put on
          their caps. Two of the women binders then come forward; one of them
          ties the master or stranger (as the case may be) with corn-ears or
          with a silken band; the other delivers a rhyming address. The
          following are specimens of the speeches made by the reaper on these
          occasions. In some parts of Pomerania every passer-by is stopped,
          his way being barred with a corn-rope. The reapers form a circle
          round him and sharpen their scythes, while their leader says:—</p>

          preliminary to mowing appears from the following variation of the
          preceding customs. In the district of Lüneburg, when any one enters
          the harvest-field, he is asked whether he will engage a good
          fellow. If he says yes, the harvesters mow some swaths, yelling and
          screaming, and then ask him for drink-money.<a id="noteref_696"

          Schleswig when a stranger comes to the threshing-floor he is asked,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I teach you the flail-dance?”</span>
          If he says yes, they put the arms of the threshing-flail round his

          tight that he is nearly choked.<a id="noteref_697" name=

          straw rope about his body. Also, as we have seen, if a stranger
          woman enters the threshing-floor, the threshers put a flail round
          her body and a wreath of corn-stalks round her neck, and call out,

          customs, observed both on the harvest-field and on the
          threshing-floor, a passing stranger is regarded as a
          personification of the corn, in other words, as the corn-spirit;
          and a show is made of treating him like the corn by mowing,
          binding, and threshing him. If the reader still doubts whether
          European peasants can really regard a passing stranger in this
          light, the following custom should set his doubts at rest. During
          the madder-harvest in the Dutch province of Zealand a stranger
          passing by a field, where the people are digging the madder-roots,
          will sometimes call out to them <span lang="nl" class=

          and, if they catch him, they bring him back to the madder-field and
          bury him in the earth up to his middle at least, jeering at him the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last act is
          to be explained as follows. The spirit of the corn and of other
          cultivated plants is sometimes conceived, not as immanent in the
          plant, but as its owner; hence the cutting of the corn at harvest,
          the digging of the roots, and the gathering of fruit from the
          fruit-trees are each and all of them acts of spoliation, which
          strip him of his property and reduce him to poverty. Hence he is
          often known as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Poor Man”</span> or

          Russia it is customary to leave patches of unreaped corn in the

          <span class="tei tei-q">“These ears are eventually knotted

          after it has been performed no wizard or other evilly-disposed
          person will be able to hurt the produce of the fields. The unreaped
          patch is looked upon as tabooed; and it is believed that if any one
          meddles with it he will shrivel up, and become twisted like the
          interwoven ears. Similar customs are kept up in various parts of
          Russia. Near Kursk and Voroneje, for instance, a patch of rye is
          usually left in honour of the Prophet Elijah, and in another
          district one of oats is consecrated to St. Nicholas. As it is well
          known that both the Saint and the Prophet have succeeded to the
          place once held in the estimation of the Russian people by Perun,
          it seems probable that Volos really was, in ancient times, one of

          he cultivates for their benefit the same plants which he cultivates

          originally intended for the benefit, not of the human poor, but of
          the poor spirits of the corn and the vine, who had just been
          despoiled by the reapers and the vintagers, and who, if some
          provision were not made for their subsistence, would naturally die
          of hunger before another year came round. In providing for their
          wants the prudent husbandman was really consulting his own
          interests; for how could he expect to reap wheat and barley and to
          gather grapes next year if he suffered the spirits of the corn and
          of the vine to perish of famine in the meantime? This train of
          thought may possibly explain the wide-spread custom of offering the
          first-fruits of the crops to gods or spirits:<a id="noteref_721"

          offerings may have been originally not so much an expression of
          gratitude for benefits received as a means of enabling the
          benefactors to continue their benefactions in time to come.
          Primitive man has generally a shrewd eye to the main chance: he is
          more prone to provide for the future than to sentimentalise over
          the past.</p>

          representative—the passing stranger—should upbraid them; and it is
          equally natural that they should seek to disable him from pursuing
          them and recapturing the stolen property. Now, it is an old
          superstition that by easing nature on the spot where a robbery is
          committed, the robbers secure themselves, for a certain time,

          when madder-diggers resort to this proceeding in presence of the
          stranger whom they have caught and buried in the field, we may
          infer that they consider themselves robbers and him as the person
          robbed. Regarded as such, he must be the natural owner of the
          madder-roots, that is, their spirit or demon; and this conception
          is carried out by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg

          cobs of the still green and milky maize are about to coagulate and
          ripen, they used to sacrifice to the goddess four young girls,
          chosen among the noblest families of the country; they were decked
          out in festal attire, crowned with flowers, and conveyed in rich
          palanquins to the brink of the hallowed waters, where the sacrifice
          was to be offered. The priests, clad in long floating robes, their
          heads encircled with feather crowns, marched in front of the
          litters carrying censers with burning incense. The town of
          Elopango, celebrated for its temple, was near the lake of the same
          name, the etymology of which refers to the sheaves of tender maize
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">elotl</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘sheaf of tender maize’</span>). It was dedicated to
          the goddess Xochiquetzal, to whom the young victims were offered by
          being hurled from the top of a rock into the abyss. At the moment
          of consummating this inhuman rite, the priests addressed themselves
          in turn to the four virgins in order to banish the fear of death
          from their minds. They drew for them a bright picture of the
          delights they were about to enjoy in the company of the gods, and
          advised them not to forget the earth which they had left behind,
          but to entreat the divinity, to whom they despatched them, to bless
          the forthcoming harvest.”</span><a id="noteref_730" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pawnees
          annually sacrificed a human victim in spring when they sowed their
          fields. The sacrifice was believed to have been enjoined on them by
          the Morning Star, or by a certain bird which the Morning Star had
          sent to them as its messenger. The bird was stuffed and preserved
          as a powerful talisman. They thought that an omission of this
          sacrifice would be followed by the total failure of the crops of
          maize, beans, and pumpkins. The victim was a captive of either sex.
          He was clad in the gayest and most costly attire, was fattened on
          the choicest food, and carefully kept in ignorance of his doom.
          When he was fat enough, they bound him to a cross in the presence
          of the multitude, danced a solemn dance, then cleft his head with a
          tomahawk and shot him with arrows. According to one trader, the
          squaws then cut pieces of flesh from the victim's body, with which
          they greased their hoes; but this was denied by another trader who
          had been present at the ceremony. Immediately after the sacrifice
          the people proceeded to plant their fields. A particular account
          has been preserved of the sacrifice of a Sioux girl by the Pawnees
          in April 1837 or 1838. The girl was fourteen or fifteen years old
          and had been kept for six months and well treated. Two days before
          the sacrifice she was led from wigwam to wigwam, accompanied by the
          whole council of chiefs and warriors. At each lodge she received a
          small billet of wood and a little paint, which she handed to the
          warrior next to her. In this way she called at every wigwam,
          receiving at each the same present of wood and paint. On the
          twenty-second of April she was taken out to be sacrificed, attended
          by the warriors, each of whom carried two pieces of wood
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name=
          "Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which he had
          received from her hands. Her body having been painted half red and
          half black, she was attached to a sort of gibbet and roasted for
          some time over a slow fire, then shot to death with arrows. The
          chief sacrificer next tore out her heart and devoured it. While her
          flesh was still warm it was cut in small pieces from the bones, put
          in little baskets, and taken to a neighbouring corn-field. There
          the head chief took a piece of the flesh from a basket and squeezed
          a drop of blood upon the newly-deposited grains of corn. His
          example was followed by the rest, till all the seed had been
          sprinkled with the blood; it was then covered up with earth.
          According to one account the body of the victim was reduced to a
          kind of paste, which was rubbed or sprinkled not only on the maize
          but also on the potatoes, the beans, and other seeds to fertilise
          them. By this sacrifice they hoped to obtain plentiful crops.<a id=

          at least one human head at planting and one at sowing. The
          head-hunters go out in twos or threes, lie in wait for the victim,

          surrounded by large stones which serve as seats. The people then
          dance round them and feast and get drunk. When the flesh has

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Wild Wa, an
          agricultural tribe on the north-eastern frontier of Upper Burma,
          still hunt for human heads as a means of promoting the welfare of
          the crops. The Wa regards his skulls as a protection against the
          powers of evil. <span class="tei tei-q">“Without a skull his crops
          would fail; without a skull his kine might die; without a skull the
          father and mother spirits would be shamed and might be enraged; if
          there were no protecting skull the other spirits who are all
          malignant, might gain entrance and kill the inhabitants, or drink
          all the liquor.”</span> The Wa country is a series of mountain
          ranges shelving rapidly down to narrow valleys from two to five
          thousand feet deep. The villages are all perched high on the
          slopes, some just under the crest of the ridge, some lower down on
          a small projecting spur of flat ground. Industrious cultivation has
          cleared away the jungle, and the villages stand out conspicuously
          in the landscape as yellowish-brown blotches on the hillsides. Each
          village is fortified by an earthen rampart so thickly overgrown
          with cactuses and other shrubs as to be impenetrable. The only
          entrance is through a narrow, low and winding tunnel, the floor of
          which, for additional security, is thickly studded with pegs to
          wound the feet of enemies who might attempt to force a way in. The
          Wa depend for their subsistence mainly on their crops of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name=
          "Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> buckwheat, beans,
          and maize; rice they cultivate only to distil a strong spirituous
          liquor from it. They had need be industrious, for no field can be
          reached without a climb up or down the steep mountain-side.
          Sometimes the rice-fields lie three thousand feet or more below the
          village, and they require constant attention. But the chief crop
          raised by the Wa is the poppy, from which they make opium. In
          February and March the hill-tops for miles are white with the
          blossom, and you may travel for days through nothing but fields of
          poppies. Then, too, is the proper season for head-hunting. It opens
          in March and lasts through April. Parties of head-hunters at that
          time go forth to prowl for human prey. As a rule they will not
          behead people of a neighbouring village nor even of any village on
          the same range of hills. To find victims they go to the next range
          or at any rate to a distance, and the farther the better, for the
          heads of strangers are preferred. The reason is that the ghosts of
          strangers, being unfamiliar with the country, are much less likely
          to stray away from their skulls; hence they make more vigilant
          sentinels than the ghosts of people better acquainted with the
          neighbourhood, who are apt to go off duty without waiting for the
          tedious formality of relieving guard. When head-hunters return to a
          village with human heads, the rejoicing is uproarious. Then the
          great drum is beaten frantically, and its deep hollow boom
          resounding far and wide through the hills announces to the
          neighbourhood the glad tidings of murder successfully perpetrated.
          Then the barrels, or rather the bamboos, of rice-spirit are tapped,
          and while the genial stream flows and the women and children dance
          and sing for glee, the men drink themselves blind and mad drunk.
          The ghastly head, which forms the centre of all this rejoicing, is
          first taken to the spirit-house, a small shed which usually stands
          on the highest point of the village site. There, wrapt in grass or
          leaves, it is hung up in a basket to ripen and bleach. When all the
          flesh and sinews have mouldered away and nothing remains but the
          blanched and grinning skull, it is put to rest in the village
          Golgotha. This is an avenue of huge old trees, whose interlacing
          boughs form a verdant archway overhead and, with the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dense undergrowth, cast a deep shadow
          on the ground below. Every village has such an avenue stretching
          along the hillside sometimes for a long distance, or even till it
          meets the avenue of the neighbouring village. In the solemn gloom
          of this verdurous canopy is the Place of Skulls. On one side of the
          avenue stands a row of wooden posts, usually mere trunks of trees
          with the bark peeled off, but sometimes rudely carved and painted
          with designs in red and black. A little below the top of each post
          is cut a niche, and in front of the niche is a ledge. On this ledge
          the skull is deposited, sometimes so that it is in full view of
          passers-by in the avenue, sometimes so that it only grins at them
          through a slit. Most villages count their skulls by tens or
          twenties, but some of them have hundreds of these trophies,
          especially when the avenue forms an unbroken continuity of shade
          between the villages. The old skulls ensure peace to the village,
          but at least one new one should be taken every year, that the rice
          may grow green far down in the depths of the valley, that the maize
          may tinge with its golden hue the steep mountain-sides, and that
          the hilltops may be white for miles and miles with the bloom of the
          poppy.<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href=

          with the same excellent intention.<a id="noteref_744" name=

          hill tribe Kudulu, near Vizagapatam in the Madras Presidency,
          offered human sacrifices to the god Jankari for the purpose of
          obtaining good crops. The ceremony was generally performed on the
          Sunday before or after the Pongal feast. For the most part the
          victim was purchased, and until the time for the sacrifice came he
          was free to wander about the village, to eat and drink what he
          liked, and even to lie with any woman he met. On the appointed day
          he was carried before the idol drunk; and when one of the villagers
          had cut a hole in his stomach and smeared the blood on the idol,
          the crowds from the neighbouring villages rushed upon him and
          hacked him to pieces. All who were fortunate enough to secure
          morsels of his flesh carried them away and presented them to their
          village idols.<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href=

          Gonds of India, a Dravidian race, kidnapped Brahman boys, and kept
          them as victims to be sacrificed on various occasions. At sowing
          and reaping, after a triumphal procession, one of the lads was
          slain by being punctured with a poisoned arrow. His blood was then
          sprinkled over the ploughed field or the ripe crop, and his flesh
          was devoured.<a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href=

          Oraons or Uraons of Chota Nagpur worship a goddess called Anna
          Kuari, who can give good crops and make a man rich, but to induce
          her to do so it is necessary to offer human sacrifices. In spite of
          the vigilance of the British Government these sacrifices are said
          to be still secretly perpetrated. The victims are poor waifs and
          strays whose disappearance attracts no notice. April and May are
          the months when the catchpoles are out on the prowl. At that time
          strangers will not go about the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> country alone, and parents will not let their
          children enter the jungle or herd the cattle. When a catchpole has
          found a victim, he cuts his throat and carries away the upper part
          of the ring finger and the nose. The goddess takes up her abode in
          the house of any man who has offered her a sacrifice, and from that
          time his fields yield a double harvest. The form she assumes in the
          house is that of a small child. When the householder brings in his
          unhusked rice, he takes the goddess and rolls her over the heap to
          double its size. But she soon grows restless and can only be
          pacified with the blood of fresh human victims.<a id="noteref_747"

          known case of human sacrifices, systematically offered to ensure
          good crops, is supplied by the Khonds or Kandhs, another Dravidian
          race in Bengal. Our knowledge of them is derived from the accounts
          written by British officers who, about the middle of the nineteenth
          century, were engaged in putting them down.<a id="noteref_748"

          sacrifices were offered to the Earth Goddess, Tari Pennu or Bera
          Pennu, and were believed to ensure good crops and immunity from all
          disease and accidents. In particular, they were considered
          necessary in the cultivation of turmeric, the Khonds arguing that
          the turmeric could not have a deep red colour without the shedding
          of blood.<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href=
          "#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          victim or Meriah, as he was called, was acceptable to the goddess
          only if he had been purchased, or had been born a victim—that is,
          the son of a victim father, or had been devoted as a child by his
          father or guardian. Khonds in distress often sold their children
          for victims, <span class="tei tei-q">“considering the beatification
          of their souls certain, and their death, for the benefit of
          mankind, the most honourable possible.”</span> A man of the Panua
          tribe was once seen to load a Khond with curses, and finally to
          spit in his face, because the Khond had sold for a victim his own
          child, whom the Panua had wished to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class=

          immediately pressed forward to comfort the seller of his child,
          saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Your child has died that all the
          world may live, and the Earth Goddess herself will wipe that
          spittle from your face.”</span><a id="noteref_750" name=

          victims were often kept for years before they were sacrificed.
          Being regarded as consecrated beings, they were treated with
          extreme affection, mingled with deference, and were welcomed
          wherever they went. A Meriah youth, on attaining maturity, was
          generally given a wife, who was herself usually a Meriah or victim;
          and with her he received a portion of land and farm-stock. Their
          offspring were also victims. Human sacrifices were offered to the
          Earth Goddess by tribes, branches of tribes, or villages, both at
          periodical festivals and on extraordinary occasions. The periodical
          sacrifices were generally so arranged by tribes and divisions of
          tribes that each head of a family was enabled, at least once a
          year, to procure a shred of flesh for his fields, generally about
          the time when his chief crop was laid down.<a id="noteref_751"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mode of
          performing these tribal sacrifices was as follows. Ten or twelve
          days before the sacrifice, the victim was devoted by cutting off
          his hair, which, until then, had been kept unshorn. Crowds of men
          and women assembled to witness the sacrifice; none might be
          excluded, since the sacrifice was declared to be for all mankind.
          It was preceded by several days of wild revelry and gross
          debauchery.<a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752" href=

          the day before the sacrifice the victim, dressed in a new garment,
          was led forth from the village in solemn procession, with music and
          dancing, to the Meriah grove, a clump of high forest trees standing
          a little way from the village and untouched by the axe. There they
          tied him to a post, which was sometimes placed between two plants
          of the sankissar shrub. He was then anointed with oil, ghee, and
          turmeric, and adorned with flowers; and <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          species of reverence, which it is not easy to distinguish from
          adoration,”</span> was paid to him throughout the day. A great
          struggle now arose to obtain the smallest relic from his person; a
          particle of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
          247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          turmeric paste with which he was smeared, or a drop of his spittle,

          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“O God, we offer this sacrifice to
          you; give us good crops, seasons, and health”</span>; then speaking
          to the victim they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“We bought you

          to custom, and no sin rests with us.”</span><a id="noteref_754"

          night, were resumed, and continued till noon, when they ceased, and
          the assembly proceeded to consummate the sacrifice. The victim was
          again anointed with oil, and each person touched the anointed part,
          and wiped the oil on his own head. In some places they took the
          victim in procession round the village, from door to door, where
          some plucked hair from his head, and others begged for a drop of
          his spittle, with which they anointed their heads.<a id=

          the victim might not be bound nor make any show of resistance, the
          bones of his arms and, if necessary, his legs were broken; but
          often this precaution was rendered unnecessary by stupefying him
          with opium.<a id="noteref_756" name="noteref_756" href=

          mode of putting him to death varied in different places. One of the
          commonest modes seems to have been strangulation, or squeezing to
          death. The branch of a green tree was cleft several feet down the
          middle; the victim's neck (in other places, his chest) was inserted
          in the cleft, which the priest, aided by his assistants, strove
          with all his force to close.<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">757</span></span></a> Then
          he wounded the victim slightly with his axe, whereupon the crowd
          rushed at the wretch and hewed the flesh from the bones, leaving
          the head and bowels untouched. Sometimes he was cut up alive.<a id=

          Chinna Kimedy he was dragged along the fields, surrounded by the
          crowd, who, avoiding his head and intestines, hacked the flesh from
          his body with their knives till he died.<a id="noteref_759" name=

          Another very common mode of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> sacrifice in the same district was to fasten
          the victim to the proboscis of a wooden elephant, which revolved on
          a stout post, and, as it whirled round, the crowd cut the flesh
          from the victim while life remained. In some villages Major
          Campbell found as many as fourteen of these wooden elephants, which
          had been used at sacrifices.<a id="noteref_760" name="noteref_760"

          one district the victim was put to death slowly by fire. A low
          stage was formed, sloping on either side like a roof; upon it they
          laid the victim, his limbs wound round with cords to confine his
          struggles. Fires were then lighted and hot brands applied, to make
          him roll up and down the slopes of the stage as long as possible;
          for the more tears he shed the more abundant would be the supply of
          rain. Next day the body was cut to pieces.<a id="noteref_761" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The flesh cut
          from the victim was instantly taken home by the persons who had
          been deputed by each village to bring it. To secure its rapid
          arrival, it was sometimes forwarded by relays of men, and conveyed
          with postal fleetness fifty or sixty miles.<a id="noteref_762"

          each village all who stayed at home fasted rigidly until the flesh
          arrived. The bearer deposited it in the place of public assembly,
          where it was received by the priest and the heads of families. The
          priest divided it into two portions, one of which he offered to the
          Earth Goddess by burying it in a hole in the ground with his back
          turned, and without looking. Then each man added a little earth to
          bury it, and the priest poured water on the spot from a hill gourd.
          The other portion of flesh he divided into as many shares as there
          were heads of houses present. Each head of a house rolled his shred
          of flesh in leaves, and buried it in his favourite field, placing
          it in the earth behind his back without looking.<a id="noteref_763"

          strict silence was observed, no fire might be given out, no wood
          cut, and no strangers received. The remains of the human victim
          (namely, the head, bowels, and bones) were watched by strong
          parties the night after the sacrifice; and next morning they were
          burned, along with a whole sheep, on a funeral pile. The ashes were
          scattered over the fields, laid as paste over the houses and
          granaries, or mixed with the new corn to preserve it from

          Others sacrifice a buffalo. They tie it to a wooden post in a
          sacred grove, dance wildly round it with brandished knives, then,
          falling on the living animal, hack it to shreds and tatters in a
          few minutes, fighting and struggling with each other for every
          particle of flesh. As soon as a man has secured a piece he makes
          off with it at full speed to bury it in his fields, according to
          ancient custom, before the sun has set, and as some of them have
          far to go they must run very fast. All the women throw clods of
          earth at the rapidly retreating figures of the men, some of them
          taking very good aim. Soon the sacred grove, so lately a scene of
          tumult, is silent and deserted except for a few people who remain
          to guard all that is left of the buffalo, to wit, the head, the
          bones, and the stomach, which are burned with ceremony at the foot

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these Khond
          sacrifices the Meriahs are represented by our authorities as
          victims offered to propitiate the Earth Goddess. But from the
          treatment of the victims both before and after death it appears
          that the custom cannot be explained as merely a propitiatory
          sacrifice. A part of the flesh certainly was offered to the Earth
          Goddess, but the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
          250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          rest was buried by each householder in his fields, and the ashes of
          the other parts of the body were scattered over the fields, laid as
          paste on the granaries, or mixed with the new corn. These latter
          customs imply that to the body of the Meriah there was ascribed a
          direct or intrinsic power of making the crops to grow, quite
          independent of the indirect efficacy which it might have as an
          offering to secure the good-will of the deity. In other words, the
          flesh and ashes of the victim were believed to be endowed with a
          magical or physical power of fertilising the land. The same
          intrinsic power was ascribed to the blood and tears of the Meriah,
          his blood causing the redness of the turmeric and his tears
          producing rain; for it can hardly be doubted that, originally at
          least, the tears were supposed to bring down the rain, not merely
          to prognosticate it. Similarly the custom of pouring water on the
          buried flesh of the Meriah was no doubt a rain-charm. Again,
          magical power as an attribute of the Meriah appears in the
          sovereign virtue believed to reside in anything that came from his
          person, as his hair or spittle. The ascription of such power to the
          Meriah indicates that he was much more than a mere man sacrificed
          to propitiate a deity. Once more, the extreme reverence paid him
          points to the same conclusion. Major Campbell speaks of the Meriah
          as <span class="tei tei-q">“being regarded as something more than
          mortal,”</span><a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href=
          "#note_769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a> and
          Major Macpherson says, <span class="tei tei-q">“A species of
          reverence, which it is not easy to distinguish from adoration, is
          paid to him.”</span><a id="noteref_770" name="noteref_770" href=
          "#note_770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">770</span></span></a> In
          short, the Meriah seems to have been regarded as divine. As such,
          he may originally have represented the Earth Goddess or, perhaps, a
          deity of vegetation; though in later times he came to be regarded
          rather as a victim offered to a deity than as himself an incarnate
          god. This later view of the Meriah as a victim rather than a
          divinity may perhaps have received undue emphasis from the European
          writers who have described the Khond religion. Habituated to the
          later idea of sacrifice as an offering made to a god for the
          purpose of conciliating his favour, European observers are apt to
          interpret all religious slaughter in this sense, and to suppose
          that wherever such slaughter takes place, there must necessarily be
          a deity to whom the carnage is believed by <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class=

          preconceived ideas may unconsciously colour and warp their
          descriptions of savage rites.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same custom
          of killing the representative of a god, of which strong traces
          appear in the Khond sacrifices, may perhaps be detected in some of
          the other human sacrifices described above. Thus the ashes of the
          slaughtered Marimo were scattered over the fields; the blood of the
          Brahman lad was put on the crop and field; the flesh of the slain
          Naga was stowed in the corn-bin; and the blood of the Sioux girl
          was allowed to trickle on the seed.<a id="noteref_771" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">771</span></span></a>
          Again, the identification of the victim with the corn, in other
          words, the view that he is an embodiment or spirit of the corn, is
          brought out in the pains which seem to be taken to secure a
          physical correspondence between him and the natural object which he
          embodies or represents. Thus the Mexicans killed young victims for
          the young corn and old ones for the ripe corn; the Marimos
          sacrifice, as <span class="tei tei-q">“seed,”</span> a short, fat
          man, the shortness of his stature corresponding to that of the
          young corn, his fatness to the condition which it is desired that
          the crops may attain; and the Pawnees fattened their victims
          probably with the same view. Again, the identification of the
          victim with the corn comes out in the African custom of killing him
          with spades and hoes, and the Mexican custom of grinding him, like
          corn, between two stones.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One more point
          in these savage customs deserves to be noted. The Pawnee chief
          devoured the heart of the Sioux girl, and the Marimos and Gonds ate
          the victim's flesh. If, as we suppose, the victim was regarded as
          divine, it follows that in eating his flesh his worshippers
          believed themselves to be partaking of the body of their god.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The barbarous
          rites just described offer analogies to the harvest customs of
          Europe. Thus the fertilising virtue ascribed to the corn-spirit is
          shewn equally in the savage custom of mixing the victim's blood or
          ashes with the seed-corn and the European custom of mixing the
          grain from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg

          Again, the identification of the person with the corn appears alike
          in the savage custom of adapting the age and stature of the victim
          to the age and stature, whether actual or expected, of the crop; in
          the Scotch and Styrian rules that when the corn-spirit is conceived
          as the Maiden the last corn shall be cut by a young maiden, but
          when it is conceived as the Corn-mother it shall be cut by an old
          woman;<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href=

          in the Tyrolese expectation that if the man who gives the last
          stroke at threshing is tall, the next year's corn will be tall
          also.<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href=

          Further, the same identification is implied in the savage custom of
          killing the representative of the corn-spirit with hoes or spades
          or by grinding him between stones, and in the European custom of
          pretending to kill him with the scythe or the flail. Once more the
          Khond custom of pouring water on the buried flesh of the victim is
          parallel to the European customs of pouring water on the personal
          representative of the corn-spirit or plunging him into a
          stream.<a id="noteref_776" name="noteref_776" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To return now to
          the Lityerses story. It has been shewn that in rude society human
          beings have been commonly killed to promote the growth of the
          crops. There is therefore no improbability in the supposition that
          they may once have been killed for a like purpose in Phrygia and
          Europe; and when Phrygian legend and European folk-custom, closely
          agreeing with each other, point to the conclusion that men were so
          slain, we are bound, provisionally at least, to accept the
          conclusion. Further, both the Lityerses story and European
          harvest-customs agree in indicating that the victim was put to
          death as a representative of the corn-spirit, and this indication
          is in harmony with the view which some savages appear to take of
          the victim slain to make the crops flourish. On the whole, then, we
          may fairly suppose that both in Phrygia and in Europe the
          representative of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg
          253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the corn-spirit was annually killed upon the harvest-field. Grounds
          have been already shewn for believing that similarly in Europe the
          representative of the tree-spirit was annually slain. The proofs of
          these two remarkable and closely analogous customs are entirely
          independent of each other. Their coincidence seems to furnish fresh
          presumption in favour of both.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the question,
          How was the representative of the corn-spirit chosen? one answer
          has been already given. Both the Lityerses story and European
          folk-custom shew that passing strangers were regarded as
          manifestations of the corn-spirit escaping from the cut or threshed
          corn, and as such were seized and slain. But this is not the only
          answer which the evidence suggests. According to the Phrygian
          legend the victims of Lityerses were not simply passing strangers,
          but persons whom he had vanquished in a reaping contest and
          afterwards wrapt up in corn-sheaves and beheaded.<a id=
          "noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href="#note_777"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a> This
          suggests that the representative of the corn-spirit may have been
          selected by means of a competition on the harvest-field, in which
          the vanquished competitor was compelled to accept the fatal honour.
          The supposition is countenanced by European harvest-customs. We
          have seen that in Europe there is sometimes a contest amongst the
          reapers to avoid being last, and that the person who is vanquished
          in this competition, that is, who cuts the last corn, is often
          roughly handled. It is true we have not found that a pretence is
          made of killing him; but on the other hand we have found that a
          pretence is made of killing the man who gives the last stroke at
          threshing, that is, who is vanquished in the threshing
          contest.<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href=

          since it is in the character of representative of the corn-spirit
          that the thresher of the last corn is slain in mimicry, and since
          the same representative character attaches (as we have seen) to the
          cutter and binder as well as to the thresher of the last corn, and
          since the same repugnance is evinced by harvesters to be last in
          any one of these labours, we may conjecture that a pretence has
          been commonly made of killing the reaper and binder as well as the
          thresher of the last corn, and that in ancient times this killing
          was actually <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg
          254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          carried out. This conjecture is corroborated by the common
          superstition that whoever cuts the last corn must die soon.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a>
          Sometimes it is thought that the person who binds the last sheaf on
          the field will die in the course of next year.<a id="noteref_780"

          reason for fixing on the reaper, binder, or thresher of the last
          corn as the representative of the corn-spirit may be this. The
          corn-spirit is supposed to lurk as long as he can in the corn,
          retreating before the reapers, the binders, and the threshers at
          their work. But when he is forcibly expelled from his refuge in the
          last corn cut or the last sheaf bound or the last grain threshed,
          he necessarily assumes some other form than that of the corn-stalks
          which had hitherto been his garment or body. And what form can the
          expelled corn-spirit assume more naturally than that of the person
          who stands nearest to the corn from which he (the corn-spirit) has
          just been expelled? But the person in question is necessarily the
          reaper, binder, or thresher of the last corn. He or she, therefore,
          is seized and treated as the corn-spirit himself.</p>

          harvester who was last at reaping, binding, or threshing. But there
          is a third possibility, to which ancient legend and modern
          folk-custom alike point. Lityerses not only put strangers to death;
          he was himself slain, and apparently in the same way as he had
          slain others, namely, by being wrapt in a corn-sheaf, beheaded, and
          cast into the river; and it is implied that this happened to

          Similarly in modern harvest-customs the pretence of killing appears

          character of Attis, a god of vegetation, and that Attis was
          described by an ancient authority as <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          reaped ear of corn.”</span><a id="noteref_784" name="noteref_784"
          href="#note_784"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a> Thus
          Attis, as an embodiment of the corn-spirit, annually slain in the
          person of his representative, might be thought to be ultimately
          identical with Lityerses, the latter being simply the rustic
          prototype out of which the state religion of Attis was developed.
          It may have been so; but, on the other hand, the analogy of
          European folk-custom warns us that amongst the same people two
          distinct deities of vegetation may have their separate personal
          representatives, both of whom are slain in the character of gods at
          different times of the year. For in Europe, as we have seen, it
          appears that one man was commonly slain in the character of the
          tree-spirit in spring, and another in the character of the
          corn-spirit in autumn. It may have been so in Phrygia also. Attis
          was especially a tree-god, and his connexion with corn may have
          been only such an extension of the power of a tree-spirit as is
          indicated in customs like the Harvest-May.<a id="noteref_785" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a>
          Again, the representative of Attis appears to have been slain in
          spring; whereas Lityerses must have been slain in summer or autumn,
          according to the time of the harvest in Phrygia.<a id="noteref_786"
          name="noteref_786" href="#note_786"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">786</span></span></a> On
          the whole, then, while we are not justified in regarding Lityerses
          as the prototype of Attis, the two may be regarded as parallel
          products of the same religious idea, and may have stood to each
          other as in Europe the Old Man of harvest <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> stands to the Wild Man, the Leaf Man, and so
          forth, of spring. Both were spirits or deities of vegetation, and
          the personal representatives of both were annually slain. But
          whereas the Attis worship became elevated into the dignity of a
          State religion and spread to Italy, the rites of Lityerses seem
          never to have passed the limits of their native Phrygia, and always
          retained their character of rustic ceremonies performed by peasants
          on the harvest-field. At most a few villages may have clubbed
          together, as amongst the Khonds, to procure a human victim to be
          slain as representative of the corn-spirit for their common
          benefit. Such victims may have been drawn from the families of
          priestly kings or kinglets, which would account for the legendary
          character of Lityerses as the son of a Phrygian king or as himself
          a king. When villages did not so club together, each village or
          farm may have procured its own representative of the corn-spirit by
          dooming to death either a passing stranger or the harvester who
          cut, bound, or threshed the last sheaf. Perhaps in the olden time
          the practice of head-hunting as a means of promoting the growth of
          the corn may have been as common among the rude inhabitants of
          Europe and Western Asia as it still is, or was till lately, among
          the primitive agricultural tribes of Assam, Burma, the Philippine
          Islands, and the Indian Archipelago.<a id="noteref_787" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a> It is
          hardly necessary to add that in Phrygia, as in Europe, the old
          barbarous custom of killing a man on the harvest-field or the
          threshing-floor had doubtless passed into a mere pretence long
          before the classical era, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg
          257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and was probably regarded by the reapers and threshers themselves
          as no more than a rough jest which the license of a harvest-home
          permitted them to play off on a passing stranger, a comrade, or
          even on their master himself.<a id="noteref_788" name="noteref_788"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have dwelt on
          the Lityerses song at length because it affords so many points of

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> to
          the Phrygian Lityerses helps to bear out the interpretation which
          has been given of the latter. Bormus, whose death or rather
          disappearance was annually mourned by the reapers in a plaintive
          song, was, like Lityerses, a king's son or at least the son of a
          wealthy and distinguished man. The reapers whom he watched were at
          work on his own fields, and he disappeared in going to fetch water
          for them; according to one version of the story he was carried off
          by the nymphs, doubtless the nymphs of the spring or pool or river
          whither he went to draw water.<a id="noteref_791" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a>
          Viewed in the light of the Lityerses story and of European
          folk-custom, this disappearance of Bormus may be a reminiscence of
          the custom of binding the farmer himself in a corn-sheaf and
          throwing him into the water. The mournful strain which the reapers
          sang was probably a lamentation over the death of the corn-spirit,
          slain either in the cut corn or in the person of a human
          representative; and the call which they addressed to him may have
          been a prayer that he might return in fresh vigour next year.</p>

          Minor, as we learn from Homer; and this, combined with the legend
          of Syleus, suggests that in ancient times passing strangers were
          handled by vintagers and vine-diggers in much the same way as they
          are said to have been handled by the reaper Lityerses. The Lydian
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name=
          "Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Syleus, so ran the
          legend, compelled passers-by to dig for him in his vineyard, till
          Hercules came and killed him and dug up his vines by the
          roots.<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href=
          "#note_792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">792</span></span></a> This
          seems to be the outline of a legend like that of Lityerses; but
          neither ancient writers nor modern folk-custom enable us to fill in
          the details.<a id="noteref_793" name="noteref_793" href=
          "#note_793"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">793</span></span></a> But,
          further, the Linus song was probably sung also by Phoenician
          reapers, for Herodotus compares it to the Maneros song, which, as
          we have seen, was a lament raised by Egyptian reapers over the cut
          corn. Further, Linus was identified with Adonis, and Adonis has
          some claims to be regarded as especially a corn-deity.<a id=
          "noteref_794" name="noteref_794" href="#note_794"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">794</span></span></a> Thus
          the Linus lament, as sung at harvest, would be identical with the
          Adonis lament; each would be the lamentation raised by reapers over
          the dead spirit of the corn. But whereas Adonis, like Attis, grew
          into a stately figure of mythology, adored and mourned in splendid
          cities far beyond the limits of his Phoenician home, Linus appears
          to have remained a simple ditty sung by reapers and vintagers among
          the corn-sheaves and the vines. The analogy of Lityerses and of
          folk-custom, both European and savage, suggests that in Phoenicia
          the slain corn-spirit—the dead Adonis—may formerly have been
          represented by a human victim; and this suggestion is possibly
          supported by the Harran legend that Tammuz (Adonis) was slain by
          his cruel lord, who ground his bones in a mill and scattered them
          to the wind. For in Mexico, as we have seen, the human victim at
          harvest was crushed between two stones; and both in Africa and
          India the ashes or other remains of the victim were scattered over
          the fields.<a id="noteref_795" name="noteref_795" href=
          "#note_795"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">795</span></span></a> But
          the Harran legend may be only a mythical way of expressing the
          grinding of corn in the mill and the scattering of the seed. It
          seems worth suggesting that the mock king who was annually killed
          at the Babylonian festival of the Sacaea on the sixteenth day of
          the month Lous may have represented Tammuz himself. For the
          historian Berosus, who records the festival and its date, probably
          used the Macedonian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg
          259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          calendar, since he dedicated his history to Antiochus Soter; and in
          his day the Macedonian month Lous appears to have corresponded to
          the Babylonian month Tammuz.<a id="noteref_796" name="noteref_796"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a> If
          this conjecture is right, the view that the mock king at the Sacaea
          was slain in the character of a god would be established. But to
          this point we shall return later on.</p>

          the legend of Busiris seems to preserve a reminiscence of human
          sacrifices once offered by the Egyptians in connexion with the
          worship of Osiris. Busiris was said to have been an Egyptian king
          who sacrificed all strangers on the altar of Zeus. The origin of
          the custom was traced to a dearth which afflicted the land of Egypt
          for nine years. A Cyprian seer informed Busiris that the dearth
          would cease if a man were annually sacrificed to Zeus. So Busiris
          instituted the sacrifice. But when Hercules came to Egypt, and was
          being dragged to the altar to be sacrificed, he burst his bonds and
          slew Busiris and his son.<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798"

          then is a legend that in Egypt a human victim was annually
          sacrificed to prevent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
          260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the failure of the crops, and a belief is implied that an omission
          of the sacrifice would have entailed a recurrence of that
          infertility which it was the object of the sacrifice to prevent. So
          the Pawnees, as we have seen, believed that an omission of the
          human sacrifice at planting would have been followed by a total
          failure of their crops. The name Busiris was in reality the name of
          a city, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the light of
          the foregoing discussion the Egyptian tradition of Busiris admits
          of a consistent and fairly probable explanation. Osiris, the
          corn-spirit, was annually represented at harvest by a stranger,
          whose red hair made him a suitable representative of the ripe corn.
          This man, in his representative character, was slain on the
          harvest-field, and mourned by the reapers, who prayed at the same
          time that the corn-spirit might revive and return (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mââ-ne-rha</span></span>, Maneros) with
          renewed vigour in the following year. Finally, the victim, or some
          part of him, was burned, and the ashes scattered by winnowing-fans
          over the fields to fertilise them. Here the choice of the victim on
          the ground of his resemblance to the corn which he was to represent
          agrees with the Mexican and African customs already
          described.<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href=

          Similarly the woman who died in the character of the Corn-mother at
          the Mexican midsummer sacrifice had her face painted red and yellow
          in token of the colours of the corn, and she wore a pasteboard
          mitre surmounted by waving plumes in imitation of the tassel of the

          heathen of Harran offered to the sun, moon, and planets human
          victims who were chosen on the ground of their supposed resemblance
          to the heavenly bodies to which they were sacrificed; for example,
          the priests, clothed in red and smeared with blood, offered a
          red-haired, red-cheeked man to <span class="tei tei-q">“the red

          and the like cases of assimilating the victim to the god, or to the
          natural phenomenon which he represents, are based ultimately on the
          principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic, the notion being that
          the object aimed at will be most readily attained by means of a
          sacrifice which resembles the effect that it is designed to bring
          about.</p>

          the use of winnowing-fans for the purpose is another hint of his
          identification with the corn. So in Vendée a pretence is made of
          threshing and winnowing the farmer's wife, regarded as an

          very well be a reminiscence of a custom, like that observed by the
          Khonds, of dividing the human victim in pieces and burying the
          pieces, often at intervals of many miles from each other, in the
          fields.<a id="noteref_811" name="noteref_811" href=

          However, it is possible that the story of the dismemberment of
          Osiris, like the similar story told of Tammuz, may have been simply
          a mythical expression for the scattering of the seed. Once more,
          the legend that the body of Osiris enclosed in a coffer was thrown
          by Typhon into the Nile, perhaps points to a custom of casting the
          body of the victim, or at least a portion of it, into the Nile as a
          rain-charm, or rather to make the river rise. For a similar purpose
          Phrygian reapers seem to have flung the headless bodies of their
          victims, wrapt in corn-sheaves, into a river, and the Khonds poured
          water on the buried flesh of the human victim. Probably when Osiris
          ceased to be represented by a human victim, an image of him was
          annually thrown into the Nile, just as the effigy of his Syrian
          counterpart, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg
          263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Adonis, used to be cast into the sea at Alexandria. Or water may
          have been simply poured over it, as on the monument already
          mentioned<a id="noteref_812" name="noteref_812" href=
          "#note_812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          priest is seen pouring water over the body of Osiris, from which
          corn-stalks are sprouting. The accompanying legend, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This is Osiris of the mysteries, who springs from the
          returning waters,”</span> bears out the view that at the mysteries
          of Osiris a charm to make rain fall or the river rise was regularly
          wrought by pouring water on his effigy or flinging it into the
          Nile.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
          objected that the red-haired victims were slain as representatives,
          not of Osiris, but of his enemy Typhon; for the victims were called
          Typhonian, and red was the colour of Typhon, black the colour of
          Osiris.<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href=

          answer to this objection must be reserved for the present. Meantime
          it may be pointed out that if Osiris is often represented on the
          monuments as black, he is still more commonly depicted as
          green,<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href=

          appropriately enough for a corn-god, who may be conceived as black
          while the seed is under ground, but as green after it has sprouted.
          So the Greeks recognised both a Green and a Black Demeter,<a id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, if I am
          right, the key to the mysteries of Osiris is furnished by the
          melancholy cry of the Egyptian reapers, which down to Roman times
          could be heard year after year sounding across the fields,
          announcing the death of the corn-spirit, the rustic prototype of
          Osiris. Similar cries, as we have seen, were also heard on all the
          harvest-fields of Western Asia. By the ancients they are spoken of
          as songs; but to judge from the analysis of the names Linus and
          Maneros, they probably consisted only of a few words uttered in a
          prolonged musical note which could be heard for a great distance.
          Such sonorous and long-drawn cries, raised by a number of strong
          voices in concert, must have had a striking effect, and could
          hardly fail to arrest the attention <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of any wayfarer who happened to be within
          hearing. The sounds, repeated again and again, could probably be
          distinguished with tolerable ease even at a distance; but to a
          Greek traveller in Asia or Egypt the foreign words would commonly
          convey no meaning, and he might take them, not unnaturally, for the
          name of some one (Maneros, Linus, Lityerses, Bormus) upon whom the
          reapers were calling. And if his journey led him through more
          countries than one, as Bithynia and Phrygia, or Phoenicia and
          Egypt, while the corn was being reaped, he would have an
          opportunity of comparing the various harvest cries of the different
          peoples. Thus we can readily understand why these harvest cries
          were so often noted and compared with each other by the Greeks.
          Whereas, if they had been regular songs, they could not have been
          heard at such distances, and therefore could not have attracted the
          attention of so many travellers; and, moreover, even if the
          wayfarer were within hearing of them, he could not so easily have
          picked out the words.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down to recent
          times Devonshire reapers uttered cries of the same sort, and
          performed on the field a ceremony exactly analogous to that in
          which, if I am not mistaken, the rites of Osiris originated. The
          cry and the ceremony are thus described by an observer who wrote in
          the first half of the nineteenth century. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“After the wheat is all cut, on most farms in the north
          of Devon, the harvest people have a custom of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘crying the neck.’</span> I believe that this practice
          is seldom omitted on any large farm in that part of the country. It
          is done in this way. An old man, or some one else well acquainted
          with the ceremonies used on the occasion (when the labourers are
          reaping the last field of wheat), goes round to the shocks and
          sheaves, and picks out a little bundle of all the best ears he can
          find; this bundle he ties up very neat and trim, and plats and
          arranges the straws very tastefully. This is called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span> of wheat, or wheaten-ears. After the
          field is cut out, and the pitcher once more circulated, the
          reapers, binders, and the women stand round in a circle. The person
          with <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span> stands in the
          centre, grasping it with both his hands. He first stoops and holds
          it near the ground, and all the men forming the ring take off their
          hats, stooping and holding them <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> with both hands towards the ground. They then
          all begin at once in a very prolonged and harmonious tone to cry
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘The neck!’</span> at the same time slowly
          raising themselves upright, and elevating their arms and hats above
          their heads; the person with <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
          neck’</span> also raising it on high. This is done three times.
          They then change their cry to <span class="tei tei-q">‘Wee
          yen!’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Way yen!’</span>—which they
          sound in the same prolonged and slow manner as before, with
          singular harmony and effect, three times. This last cry is
          accompanied by the same movements of the body and arms as in crying
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck.’</span>... After having thus
          repeated <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span> three times, and
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘wee yen,’</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘way yen’</span> as often, they all burst out into a
          kind of loud and joyous laugh, flinging up their hats and caps into
          the air, capering about and perhaps kissing the girls. One of them
          then gets 'the neck' and runs as hard as he can down to the
          farmhouse, where the dairymaid, or one of the young female
          domestics, stands at the door prepared with a pail of water. If he
          who holds <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span> can manage to
          get into the house, in any way unseen, or openly, by any other way
          than the door at which the girl stands with the pail of water, then
          he may lawfully kiss her; but, if otherwise, he is regularly soused
          with the contents of the bucket. On a fine still autumn evening the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘crying of the neck’</span> has a wonderful
          effect at a distance, far finer than that of the Turkish muezzin,
          which Lord Byron eulogises so much, and which he says is preferable
          to all the bells in Christendom. I have once or twice heard upwards
          of twenty men cry it, and sometimes joined by an equal number of
          female voices. About three years back, on some high grounds, where
          our people were harvesting, I heard six or seven <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘necks’</span> cried in one night, although I know that
          some of them were four miles off. They are heard through the quiet
          evening air at a considerable distance sometimes.”</span><a id=

          this is adorned with ribbons and flowers, and one part is tied
          quite tight, so as to look like a neck. Then they cry out
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Our (my) side, my side,’</span> as loud as
          they can; then the dairymaid gives the neck to the head

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have him, I have him, I have

          to the field when the last corn was cut, the <span class=

          Another account relates that one of the men rushed from the field
          with the last sheaf, while the rest pursued him with vessels of

          brought into the barn.<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similar customs
          appear to have been formerly observed in Pembrokeshire, as appears
          from the following account, in which, however, nothing is said of
          the sonorous cries raised by the reapers when their work was done:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“At harvest-time, in South Pembrokeshire,
          the last ears of corn left standing in the field were tied
          together, and the harvesters then tried to cut this neck by
          throwing their hatchets at it. What happened afterwards appears to
          have varied somewhat. I have been told by one old man that the one
          who got possession of the neck would carry it over into some
          neighbouring field, leave it there, and take to his heels as fast
          as he could; for, if caught, he had a rough time of it. The men who
          caught him would shut him up in a barn without food, or belabour
          him soundly, or perhaps shoe him, as it was called, beating the
          soles of his feet with rods—a very severe and much-dreaded
          punishment. On my grandfather's farm the man used to make for the
          house as fast as possible, and try to carry in the neck. The maids
          were on the look-out for him, and did their best to drench him with
          water. If they succeeded, they got the present of half-a-crown,
          which my grandfather always gave, and which was considered a very
          liberal present indeed. If the man was successful in dodging the
          maids, and getting the neck into the house without receiving the
          wetting, the half-crown became his. The neck was then hung up, and
          kept until the following year, at any rate, like the bunches of
          flowers or boughs gathered at the St. Jean, in the south of France.
          Sometimes the necks of many successive years were to be found
          hanging up together. In these two ways of disposing of the neck one
          sees the embodiment, no doubt, of the two ways of looking at the
          corn-spirit, as good (to be kept) or as bad (to be passed on to the
          neighbour).”</span><a id="noteref_823" name="noteref_823" href=

          conceived as the neck of the corn-spirit, who is consequently

          together, and the reapers, standing ten or twenty paces off, threw

          Cornish expression <span class="tei tei-q">“the neck,”</span> as
          applied to the last sheaf. The corn-spirit is conceived in human or
          animal form, and the last standing corn is part of its body—its
          neck, its head, or its tail. Sometimes, as we have seen, the last
          corn is regarded as the navel-string.<a id="noteref_831" name=

          Lastly, the Devonshire custom of drenching with water the person
          who brings in <span class="tei tei-q">“the neck”</span> is a
          rain-charm, such as we have had many examples of. Its parallel

          only have fresh examples of killing the god, but may hope also to
          clear up some points which remain obscure in the myths and worship

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amongst the many
          animals whose forms the corn-spirit is supposed to take are the
          wolf, dog, hare, fox, cock, goose, quail, cat, goat, cow (ox,
          bull), pig, and horse. In one or other of these shapes the
          corn-spirit is often believed to be present in the corn, and to be
          caught or killed in the last sheaf. As the corn is being cut the
          animal flees before the reapers, and if a reaper is taken ill on
          the field, he is supposed to have stumbled unwittingly on the
          corn-spirit, who has thus punished the profane intruder. It is said
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Rye-wolf has got hold of him,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Harvest-goat has given him a
          push.”</span> The person who cuts the last corn or binds the last
          sheaf gets the name of the animal, as the Rye-wolf, the Rye-sow,
          the Oats-goat, and so forth, and retains the name sometimes for a
          year. Also the animal is frequently represented by a puppet made
          out of the last sheaf or of wood, flowers, and so on, which is
          carried home amid rejoicings on the last harvest-waggon. Even where
          the last sheaf is not made up in animal shape, it is often called
          the Rye-wolf, the Hare, Goat, and so forth. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Generally each kind of crop is supposed
          to have its special animal, which is caught in the last sheaf, and
          called the Rye-wolf, the Barley-wolf, the Oats-wolf, the Pea-wolf,
          or the Potato-wolf, according to the crop; but sometimes the figure
          of the animal is only made up once for all at getting in the last
          crop of the whole harvest. Sometimes the creature is believed to be
          killed by the last stroke of the sickle or scythe. But oftener it
          is thought to live so long as there is corn still unthreshed, and
          to be caught in the last sheaf threshed. Hence the man who gives
          the last stroke with the flail is told that he has got the
          Corn-sow, the Threshing-dog, or the like. When the threshing is
          finished, a puppet is made in the form of the animal, and this is
          carried by the thresher of the last sheaf to a neighbouring farm,
          where the threshing is still going on. This again shews that the
          corn-spirit is believed to live wherever the corn is still being
          threshed. Sometimes the thresher of the last sheaf himself
          represents the animal; and if the people of the next farm, who are
          still threshing, catch him, they treat him like the animal he
          represents, by shutting him up in the pig-sty, calling him with the
          cries commonly addressed to pigs, and so forth.<a id="noteref_833"

          the children are warned is not a common wolf, for he is often

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Rye-wolf will come and eat you up,

          he has all the outward appearance of a wolf. For in the
          neighbourhood of Feilenhof (East Prussia), when a wolf was seen
          running through a field, the peasants used to watch whether he
          carried his tail in the air or dragged it on the ground. If he
          dragged it on the ground, they went after him, and thanked him for
          bringing them a blessing, and even set tit-bits before him. But if
          he carried his tail high, they cursed him and tried to kill him.
          Here the wolf is the corn-spirit whose fertilising power is in his
          tail.<a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836" href=

          called Wolf or the Rye-wolf, if the crop is rye, and in many parts

          meat. Yet nobody likes to be the Wolf. The same woman may be

          the figure of a wolf about two feet long and half a foot high, the
          legs of the animal being represented by stiff stalks and its tail
          and mane by wheat-ears. This Wheat-wolf she carried back at the
          head of the harvesters to the village, where it was set up on a
          high place in the parlour of the farm and remained there for a long

          many places the sheaf called the Wolf is made up in human form and
          dressed in clothes. This indicates a confusion of ideas between the

          Sometimes the image of the cock is fastened to the top of a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          corn-spirit is killed in the form of a cock. In parts of Germany,
          Hungary, Poland, and Picardy the reapers place a live cock in the
          corn which is to be cut last, and chase it over the field, or bury
          it up to the neck in the ground; afterwards they strike off its
          head with a sickle or scythe.<a id="noteref_873" name="noteref_873"

          or behead with an old sword, or throw into the barn to the girls,
          or give to the mistress to cook. If the harvest-cock has not been
          spilt—that is, if no waggon has been upset—the harvesters have the
          right to kill the farmyard cock by throwing stones at it or
          beheading it. Where this custom has fallen into disuse, it is still
          common for the farmer's wife to make cockie-leekie for the
          harvesters, and to shew them the head of the cock which has been
          killed for the soup.<a id="noteref_874" name="noteref_874" href=

          the neighbourhood of Klausenburg, Transylvania, a cock is buried on
          the harvest-field in the earth, so that only its head appears. A
          young man then takes a scythe and cuts off the cock's head at a
          single sweep. If he fails to do this, he is called the Red Cock for
          a whole year, and people fear that next year's crop will be
          bad.<a id="noteref_875" name="noteref_875" href=
          "#note_875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">875</span></span></a> Near
          Udvarhely, in Transylvania, a live cock is bound up in the last
          sheaf and killed with a spit. It is then skinned. The flesh is
          thrown away, but the skin and feathers are kept till next year; and
          in spring the grain from the last sheaf is mixed with the feathers
          of the cock and scattered on the field which is to be tilled.<a id=

          Nothing could set in a clearer light the identification of the cock
          with the spirit of the corn. By being tied up in the last sheaf and
          killed, the cock is identified with the corn, and its death with
          the cutting of the corn. By keeping its feathers till spring, then
          mixing them with the seed-corn taken from the very sheaf in which
          the bird had been bound, and scattering the feathers together with
          the seed over the field, the identity of the bird with the corn is
          again emphasised, and its quickening and fertilising power, as an
          embodiment of the corn-spirit, is intimated in the plainest manner.
          Thus the corn-spirit, in the form of a cock, is killed at harvest,
          but rises to fresh life and activity in spring. Again, the
          equivalence of the cock to the corn is expressed, hardly less
          plainly, in the custom of burying the bird in the ground, and
          cutting off its head (like the ears of corn) with the scythe.</p>

          Galloway the reaping of the last standing corn is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“cutting the Hare.”</span> The mode of
          cutting it is as follows. When the rest of the corn has been
          reaped, a handful is left standing to form the Hare. It is divided
          into three parts and plaited, and the ears are tied in a knot. The
          reapers then retire a few yards and each throws his or her sickle
          in turn at the Hare to cut it down. It must be cut below the knot,
          and the reapers continue to throw their sickles at it, one after
          the other, until one of them succeeds in severing the stalks below
          the knot. The Hare is then carried home and given to a maidservant
          in the kitchen, who places it over the kitchen-door on the inside.
          Sometimes the Hare used to be thus kept till the next harvest. In
          the parish of Minnigaff, when the Hare was cut, the unmarried
          reapers ran home with all speed, and the one who arrived first was
          the first to be married.<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878"

          Southern Ayrshire the last corn cut is also called the Hare, and
          the mode of cutting it seems to be the same as in Galloway; at
          least in the neighbourhood of Kilmarnock the last corn left
          standing in the middle of the field is plaited, and the reapers
          used to try to cut it by throwing their sickles at it. When cut, it
          was carried home and hung up over the door.<a id="noteref_879"

          are both called the Cat. About Vesoul when they cut the last corn
          they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We have the Cat by the
          tail.”</span> At Briançon, in Dauphiné, at the beginning of reaping
          a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name=
          "Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cat is decked out
          with ribbons, flowers, and ears of corn. It is called the Cat of
          the ball-skin (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">le chat de peau de
          balle</span></span>). If a reaper is wounded at his work, they make
          the cat lick the wound. At the close of the reaping the cat is
          again decked out with ribbons and ears of corn; then they dance and
          make merry. When the dance is over the girls solemnly strip the cat
          of its finery. At Grüneberg, in Silesia, the reaper who cuts the
          last corn goes by the name of the Tom-cat. He is enveloped in
          rye-stalks and green withes, and is furnished with a long plaited
          tail. Sometimes as a companion he has a man similarly dressed, who
          is called the (female) Cat. Their duty is to run after people whom
          they see and to beat them with a long stick. Near Amiens the
          expression for finishing the harvest is, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They are going to kill the Cat”</span>; and when the
          last corn is cut they kill a cat in the farmyard. At threshing, in
          some parts of France, a live cat is placed under the last bundle of
          corn to be threshed, and is struck dead with the flails. Then on
          Sunday it is roasted and eaten as a holiday dish.<a id=

          the Vosges Mountains the close of haymaking or harvest is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“catching the cat,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“killing the dog,”</span> or more rarely <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“catching the hare.”</span> The cat, the dog, or the
          hare is said to be fat or lean according as the crop is good or
          bad. The man who cuts the last handful of hay or of wheat is said
          to catch the cat or the hare or to kill the dog. He is
          congratulated by his comrades and has the honour of carrying the
          nosegay or rather the small fir-tree decked with ribbons which
          marks the end of the haymaking or of the harvest.<a id=

          are inserted in its nostrils and mouth, and it is adorned with
          garlands of flowers. It is set up on the field and called the
          Oats-goat. When the reaping approaches an end, each reaper hastens
          to finish his piece first; he who is the last to finish gets the
          Oats-goat.<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897" href=

          Again, the last sheaf is itself called the Goat. Thus, in the
          valley of the Wiesent, Bavaria, the last sheaf bound on the field
          is called the Goat, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg
          283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          Again, the person who cuts or binds the last sheaf is called the
          Goat. Thus, in parts of Mecklenburg they call out to the woman who
          binds the last sheaf, <span class="tei tei-q">“You are the
          Harvest-goat.”</span> Near Uelzen, in Hanover, the harvest festival
          begins with <span class="tei tei-q">“the bringing of the
          Harvest-goat”</span>; that is, the woman who bound the last sheaf
          is wrapt in straw, crowned with a harvest-wreath, and brought in a
          wheelbarrow to the village, where a round dance takes place. About
          Luneburg, also, the woman who binds the last corn is decked with a
          crown of corn-ears and is called the Corn-goat.<a id="noteref_902"

          liquor. In parts of Styria, also, the man who cuts the last corn is
          called Corn-goat, Oats-goat, or the like. As a rule, the man who
          thus gets the name of Corn-goat has to bear it a whole year till

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to one
          view, the corn-spirit, who has been caught in the form of a goat or
          otherwise, lives in the farmhouse or barn over winter. Thus, each
          farm has its own embodiment of the corn-spirit. But, according to
          another view, the corn-spirit is the genius or deity, not of the
          corn <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name=
          "Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of one farm only,
          but of all the corn. Hence when the corn on one farm is all cut, he
          flees to another where there is still corn left standing. This idea
          is brought out in a harvest-custom which was formerly observed in
          Skye. The farmer who first finished reaping sent a man or woman
          with a sheaf to a neighbouring farmer who had not finished; the
          latter in his turn, when he had finished, sent on the sheaf to his
          neighbour who was still reaping; and so the sheaf made the round of
          the farms till all the corn was cut. The sheaf was called the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">goabbir bhacagh</span></span>, that is, the
          Cripple Goat.<a id="noteref_906" name="noteref_906" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">906</span></span></a> The
          custom appears not to be extinct at the present day, for it was
          reported from Skye only a few years ago. We are told that when the
          crofters and small farmers are cutting down their corn, each tries
          his best to finish before his neighbour. The first to finish goes
          to his neighbour's field and makes up at one end of it a bundle of
          sheaves in a fanciful shape which goes by the name of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gobhar bhacach</span></span> or Lame Goat. As
          each man in succession finishes reaping his field, he proceeds to
          set up a lame goat of this sort in his neighbour's field where
          there is still corn standing. No one likes to have the Lame Goat
          put in his field, <span class="tei tei-q">“not from any ill-luck it
          brings, but because it is humiliating to have it standing there
          visible to all neighbours and passers-by, and of course he cannot
          retaliate.”</span><a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">907</span></span></a> The
          corn-spirit was probably thus represented as lame because he had
          been crippled by the cutting of the corn. We have seen that
          sometimes the old woman who brings home the last sheaf must limp on
          one foot.<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href=

          the Böhmer Wald mountains, between Bohemia and Bavaria, when two
          peasants are driving home their corn together, they race against
          each other to see who shall get home first. The village boys mark
          the loser in the race, and at night they come and erect on the roof
          of his house the Oats-goat, which is a colossal figure of a goat
          made of straw.<a id="noteref_909" name="noteref_909" href=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> believed to be slain on the harvest-field by
          the sickle or scythe. Thus, in the neighbourhood of Bernkastel, on
          the Moselle, the reapers determine by lot the order in which they
          shall follow each other. The first is called the fore-reaper, the
          last the tail-bearer. If a reaper overtakes the man in front he
          reaps past him, bending round so as to leave the slower reaper in a
          patch by himself. This patch is called the Goat; and the man for
          whom <span class="tei tei-q">“the Goat is cut”</span> in this way,
          is laughed and jeered at by his fellows for the rest of the day.
          When the tail-bearer cuts the last ears of corn, it is said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He is cutting the Goat's neck
          off.”</span><a id="noteref_910" name="noteref_910" href=

          the neighbourhood of Grenoble, before the end of the reaping, a
          live goat is adorned with flowers and ribbons and allowed to run
          about the field. The reapers chase it and try to catch it. When it
          is caught, the farmer's wife holds it fast while the farmer cuts
          off its head. The goat's flesh serves to furnish the
          harvest-supper. A piece of the flesh is pickled and kept till the
          next harvest, when another goat is killed. Then all the harvesters
          eat of the flesh. On the same day the skin of the goat is made into
          a cloak, which the farmer, who works with his men, must always wear
          at harvest-time if rain or bad weather sets in. But if a reaper
          gets pains in his back, the farmer gives him the goat-skin to
          wear.<a id="noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href=

          reason for this seems to be that the pains in the back, being
          inflicted by the corn-spirit, can also be healed by it. Similarly,
          we saw that elsewhere, when a reaper is wounded at reaping, a cat,
          as the representative of the corn-spirit, is made to lick the

          probably because the corn-spirit is believed to resent especially
          the first wound; and, in order to escape pains in the back, Saxon
          reapers in Transylvania gird their loins with the first handful of
          ears which they cut.<a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href=

          Again, near Marktl, in Upper Bavaria, the sheaves are called
          Straw-goats or simply Goats. They are laid in a great heap on the
          open field and threshed by two rows of men standing opposite each
          other, who, as they ply their flails, sing a song in which they say
          that they see the Straw-goat amongst the corn-stalks. The last
          Goat, that is, the last sheaf, is adorned with a wreath of violets
          and other flowers and with cakes strung together. It is placed
          right in the middle of the heap. Some of the threshers rush at it
          and tear the best of it out; others lay on with their flails so
          recklessly that heads are sometimes broken. In threshing this last
          sheaf, each man casts up to the man opposite him the misdeeds of

          The man who gives the last stroke with the flail must carry the
          Goat to the barn of a neighbour who is still threshing and throw it

          Elsewhere, however, the corn-spirit in the form of a goat is
          apparently thought to live in the field throughout the winter.
          Hence at Wannefeld near Gardelegen, and also between Calbe and
          Salzwedel, in the Altmark, the last stalks used to be left uncut on
          the harvest-field with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“That
          shall the He-goat keep!”</span> Evidently the last corn was here
          left as a provision for the corn-spirit, lest, robbed of all his
          substance, he should die of hunger. A stranger passing a
          harvest-field is sometimes taken for the Corn-goat escaping in
          human shape from the cut or threshed grain. Thus, when a stranger
          passes a harvest-field, all the labourers stop and shout as with
          one voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“He-goat! He-goat!”</span> At
          rape-seed threshing in Schleswig, which is generally done on the
          field, the same cry is raised if the stranger does not take off his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At sowing their
          winter corn the old Prussians used to kill a goat, consume its
          flesh with many superstitious ceremonies, and hang the skin on a
          high pole near an oak and a large stone. There it remained till
          harvest, when a great bunch of corn and herbs was fastened to the
          pole above the goat-skin. Then, after a prayer had been offered by
          a peasant who acted as priest (<span lang="de" class=

          "font-style: italic">Weidulut</span></span>), the young folks
          joined hands and danced round the oak and the pole. Afterwards they
          scrambled for the bunch of corn, and the priest distributed the
          herbs with a sparing hand. Then he placed the goat-skin on the
          large stone, sat down on it, and preached to the people about the
          history of their forefathers and their old heathen customs and

          perhaps represents the corn-spirit superintending the growth of the

          corn is led thrice round the farmyard, being allured by a bait or
          driven by men with sticks, or conducted by the farmer's wife with a
          rope. The calf chosen for this ceremony is the calf which was born
          first on the farm in the spring of the year. It is followed by all
          the reapers with their tools. Then it is allowed to run free; the
          reapers chase it, and whoever catches it is called King of the
          Calf. Lastly, it is solemnly killed; at Lunéville the man who acts
          as butcher is the Jewish merchant of the village.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes again
          the corn-spirit hides himself amongst the cut corn in the barn to
          reappear in bull or cow form at threshing. Thus at Wurmlingen, in
          Thüringen, the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is called
          the Cow, or rather the Barley-cow, Oats-cow, Peas-cow, or the like,
          according to the crop. He is entirely enveloped in straw; his head
          is surmounted by sticks in imitation of horns, and two lads lead
          him by ropes to the well to drink. On the way thither he must low
          like a cow, and for a long time afterwards he goes by the name of

          Obermedlingen, in Swabia, when the threshing draws near an end,
          each man is careful to avoid giving the last stroke. He who does
          give it <span class="tei tei-q">“gets the Cow,”</span> which is a
          straw figure dressed in an old ragged petticoat, hood, and
          stockings. It is tied on his back <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          again, we meet with that confusion between the human and animal
          shape of the corn-spirit which we have noted in other customs. In
          Canton Schaffhausen the man who threshes the last corn is called
          the Cow; in Canton Thurgau, the Corn-bull; in Canton Zurich, the
          Thresher-cow. In the last-mentioned district he is wrapt in straw
          and bound to one of the trees in the orchard.<a id="noteref_941"

          Arad, in Hungary, the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is
          enveloped in straw and a cow's hide with the horns attached to
          it.<a id="noteref_942" name="noteref_942" href=

          Pessnitz, in the district of Dresden, the man who gives the last
          stroke with the flail is called Bull. He must make a straw-man and

          apparently, as in so many cases, the corn-spirit is passed on to a
          neighbour who has not finished threshing. So at Herbrechtingen, in
          Thüringen, the effigy of a ragged old woman is flung into the barn
          of the farmer who is last with his threshing. The man who throws it
          in cries, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is the Cow for
          you.”</span> If the threshers catch him they detain him over night
          and punish him by keeping him from the harvest-supper.<a id=

          call out twelve times, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are killing the
          Bull.”</span> In the neighbourhood of Bordeaux, where a butcher
          kills an ox on the field immediately after the close of the
          reaping, it is said of the man who gives the last stroke at
          threshing that <span class="tei tei-q">“he has killed the

          race takes place to it in which all the reapers join. When the last
          stroke is given at threshing they say that <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that sometimes the young corn-spirit, whose task it is to quicken

          Similarly in Berry the young corn-spirit is sometimes supposed to
          be born on the field in calf form; for when a binder has not rope
          enough to bind all the corn in sheaves, he puts aside the wheat
          that remains over and imitates the lowing of a cow. The meaning is
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“the sheaf has given birth to a

          the woman, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Bull is coming,”</span> and
          imitate the bellowing of a bull.<a id="noteref_950" name=

          these cases the woman is conceived as the Corn-cow or old
          corn-spirit, while the supposed calf is the Corn-calf or young
          corn-spirit. In some parts of Austria a mythical calf (<span lang=
          "de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Muhkälbchen</span></span>) is believed to be
          seen amongst the sprouting corn in spring and to push the children;
          when the corn waves in the wind they say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Calf is going about.”</span> Clearly, as Mannhardt

          this custom the corn-spirit in the form of a mare is passed on from
          a farm where the corn is all cut to another farm where it is still
          standing, and where therefore the corn-spirit may be supposed
          naturally to take refuge. In Shropshire the custom is similar.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Crying, calling, or shouting the mare is a
          ceremony performed by the men of that farm which is the first in
          any parish or district to finish the harvest. The object of it is

          finishes his harvest last, and who therefore cannot send the Mare
          to any one else, is said <span class="tei tei-q">“to keep her all
          winter.”</span> The mocking offer of the Mare was sometimes
          responded to by a mocking acceptance of her help. Thus an old man
          told an enquirer, <span class="tei tei-q">“While we wun at supper,
          a mon cumm'd wi' a autar [halter] to fatch <span class="tei tei-pb"

          near Leebotwood), down to about 1850, the Mare used really to be
          sent. <span class="tei tei-q">“The head man of the farmer who had
          finished harvest first was mounted on the best horse of the
          team—the leader—both horse and man being adorned with ribbons,
          streamers, etc. Thus arrayed, a boy on foot led the pair in triumph
          to the neighbouring farmhouses. Sometimes the man who took the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘mare’</span> received, as well as plenty
          of harvest-ale, some rather rough, though good-humoured, treatment,

          on it. The reapers dance round the last blades of corn, crying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“See the remains of the Horse.”</span> The
          sheaf made out of these last blades is given to the youngest horse
          of the parish (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">commune</span></span>) to eat. This youngest
          horse of the parish clearly represents, as Mannhardt says, the
          corn-spirit of the following year, the Corn-foal, which absorbs the
          spirit of the old Corn-horse by eating the last corn cut; for, as
          usual, the old corn-spirit takes his final refuge in the last
          sheaf. The thresher of the last sheaf is said to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“beat the Horse.”</span><a id="noteref_956" name=

          Again, a trace of the horse-shaped corn-spirit is reported from
          Berry. The harvesters there are accustomed to take a noonday nap in
          the field. This is called <span class="tei tei-q">“seeing the
          Horse.”</span> The leader or <span class="tei tei-q">“King”</span>
          of the harvesters gives the signal for going to sleep. If he delays
          giving the signal, one of the harvesters will begin to neigh like a
          horse, the rest imitate him, and then they all go <span class=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
          corn-spirit assumes the form of a bird. Thus among the Saxons of
          the Bistritz district in Transylvania there is a saying that the
          quail is sitting in the last standing stalks on the harvest-field,
          and all the reapers rush at these stalks in order, as they say, to
          catch the quail.<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href=
          "#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a>
          Exactly the same expression is used by reapers in Austrian Silesia
          when they are about to cut the last standing corn, whatever the
          kind of grain may be.<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href=
          "#note_959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a> In
          the Bocage of Normandy, when the reapers have come to the last ears
          of the last rig, they surround them for the purpose of catching the
          quail, which is supposed to have taken refuge there. They run about
          the corn crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind the Quail!”</span>
          and make believe to grab at the bird amid shouts and
          laughter.<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href=
          "#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a>
          Connected with this identification of the corn-spirit with a quail
          is probably the belief that the cry of the bird in spring is
          prophetic of the price of corn in the autumn; in Germany they say
          that corn will sell at as many gulden a bushel as the quail uttered
          its cry over the fields in spring. Similar prognostications are
          drawn from the note of the bird in central and western France, in
          Switzerland and in Tuscany.<a id="noteref_961" name="noteref_961"
          href="#note_961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a>
          Perhaps one reason for identifying the quail with the corn-spirit
          is that the bird lays its eggs on the ground, without making much
          of a nest.<a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href=
          "#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a>
          Similarly the Toradjas of Central Celebes think that the soul of
          the rice is embodied in a pretty little blue bird which builds its
          nest in the rice-field at the time when the rice is beginning to
          germinate, and which disappears again after the harvest. Thus both
          the place and the time of the appearance of the bird suggest to the
          natives the notion that the blue bird is the rice incarnate. And
          like the note of the quail in Europe the note of this <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> little bird in Celebes is believed to
          prognosticate the state of the harvest, foretelling whether the
          rice will be abundant or scarce. Nobody may drive the bird away; to
          do so would not merely injure the rice, it would hurt the eyes of
          the sacrilegious person and might even strike him blind. In
          Minahassa, a district in the north of Celebes, a similar though
          less definite belief attaches to a sort of small quail which loves
          to haunt the rice-fields before the rice is reaped; and when the
          Galelareeze of Halmahera hear a certain kind of bird, which they
          call <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">togè</span></span>, croaking among the rice in
          ear, they say that the bird is putting the grain into the rice, so
          they will not kill it.<a id="noteref_963" name="noteref_963" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another animal
          whose shape the corn-spirit is sometimes thought to assume is the
          fox. The conception is recorded at various places in Germany and
          France. Thus at Nördlingen in Bavaria, when the corn waves to and
          fro in the wind, they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The fox goes
          through the corn,”</span> and at Usingen in Nassau they say,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The foxes are marching through the
          corn.”</span> At Ravensberg, in Westphalia, and at Steinau, in
          Kurhessen, children are warned against straying in the corn,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“because the Fox is there.”</span> At
          Campe, near Stade, when they are about to cut the last corn, they
          call out to the reaper, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Fox is sitting
          there, hold him fast!”</span> In the Department of the Moselle they
          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Watch whether the Fox comes
          out.”</span> In Bourbonnais the expression is, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You will catch the Fox.”</span> When a reaper wounds
          himself or is sick at reaping, they say in the Lower Loire that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He has the Fox.”</span> In Côte-d'or they
          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“He has killed the Fox.”</span> At
          Louhans, in Sâone-et-Loire, when the reapers are cutting the last
          corn they leave a handful standing and throw their sickles at it.
          He who hits it is called the Fox, and two girls deck his bonnet
          with flowers. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg
          297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          In the evening there is a dance, at which the Fox dances with all
          the girls. The supper which follows is also called the Fox; they
          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We have eaten the Fox,”</span>
          meaning that they have partaken of the harvest-supper. In the
          Canton of Zurich the last sheaf is called the Fox. At Bourgogne, in
          Ain, they cry out, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Fox is sitting in
          the last sheaf,”</span> and having made the figure of an animal out
          of white cloth and some ears of the last corn, they dub it the Fox
          and throw it into the house of a neighbour who has not yet got in
          all his harvest.<a id="noteref_964" name="noteref_964" href=
          "#note_964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a> In
          Poitou, when the corn is being reaped in a district, all the
          reapers strive to finish as quickly as possible in order that they
          may send <span class="tei tei-q">“the Fox”</span> to the fields of
          a farmer who has not yet garnered his sheaves. The man who cuts the
          last handful of standing corn is said to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“have the Fox.”</span> This last handful is carried to
          the farmer's house and occupies a place on the table during the
          harvest-supper; and the custom is to drench it with water. After
          that it is set up on the chimney-piece and remains there the whole
          year.<a id="noteref_965" name="noteref_965" href=

          threshing, also, in Sâone-et-Loire, the last sheaf is called the
          Fox; in Lot they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are going to beat
          the Fox”</span>; and at Zabern in Alsace they set a stuffed fox
          before the door of the threshing-floor of a neighbour who has not

          this conception of the fox as an embodiment of the corn-spirit may
          possibly be connected an old custom, observed in Holstein and
          Westphalia, of carrying a dead or living fox from house to house in
          spring; the intention of the custom was perhaps to diffuse the
          refreshing and invigorating influence of the reawakened spirit of
          vegetation.<a id="noteref_967" name="noteref_967" href=

          pig along with the tail, and brings it to the sower on the field.
          He eats of it, but cuts off the tail and sticks it in the field; it

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the idea of
          the corn-spirit as embodied in pig form is nowhere more clearly
          expressed than in the Scandinavian custom of the Yule Boar. In
          Sweden and Denmark at Yule (Christmas) it is the custom to bake a
          loaf in the form of a boar-pig. This is called the Yule Boar. The
          corn of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg

          the last sheaf is often used to make it. All through Yule the Yule
          Boar stands on the table. Often it is kept till the sowing-time in
          spring, when part of it is mixed with the seed-corn and part given
          to the ploughmen and plough-horses or plough-oxen to eat, in the
          expectation of a good harvest.<a id="noteref_984" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">984</span></span></a> In
          this custom the corn-spirit, immanent in the last sheaf, appears at
          midwinter in the form of a boar made from the corn of the last
          sheaf; and his quickening influence on the corn is shewn by mixing
          part of the Yule Boar with the seed-corn, and giving part of it to
          the ploughman and his cattle to eat. Similarly we saw that the
          Corn-wolf makes his appearance at midwinter, the time when the year
          begins to verge towards spring.<a id="noteref_985" name=

          may conjecture that the Yule straw, which Swedish peasants turn to
          various superstitious uses, comes, in part at least, from the sheaf
          out of which the Yule Boar is made. The Yule straw is long
          rye-straw, a portion of which is always set apart for this season.
          It is strewn over the floor at Christmas, and the peasants
          attribute many virtues to it. For example, they think that some of
          it scattered on the ground will make a barren field productive.
          Again, the peasant at Christmas seats himself on a log; and his
          eldest son or daughter, or the mother herself, if the children are
          not old enough, places a wisp of the Yule straw on his knee. From
          this he draws out single straws, and throws them, one by one, up to
          the ceiling; and as many as lodge in the rafters, so many will be
          the sheaves of rye he will have to thresh at harvest.<a id=

          Again, it is only the Yule straw which may be used in binding the
          fruit-trees as a charm to fertilise them.<a id="noteref_987" name=

          uses of the Yule straw shew that it is believed to possess
          fertilising virtues analogous to those ascribed to the Yule Boar;
          we may therefore fairly conjecture that the Yule straw is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name=
          "Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> made from the same

          apparently also a man in the character of the Yule Boar. This, at
          least, may perhaps be inferred from a Christmas custom still
          observed in Sweden. A man is wrapt up in a skin, and carries a wisp
          of straw in his mouth, so that the projecting straws look like the
          bristles of a boar. A knife is brought, and an old woman, with her
          face blackened, pretends to sacrifice him.<a id="noteref_989" name=

          in some parts of the Esthonian island of Oesel they bake a long

          is distributed among the cattle. In other parts of the island the
          Christmas Boar is not a cake but a little pig born in March, which
          the housewife fattens secretly, often without the knowledge of the
          other members of the family. On Christmas Eve the little pig is
          secretly killed, then roasted in the oven, and set on the table
          standing on all fours, where it remains in this posture for several
          days. In other parts of the island, again, though the Christmas
          cake has neither the name nor the shape of a boar, it is kept till
          the New Year, when half of it is divided among all the members and
          all the quadrupeds of the family. The other half of the cake is

          shape and a cross is impressed on it with a pig's bone or a key, or
          three dints are made in it with a buckle or a piece of charcoal. It
          stands with a light beside it on the table all through the festal
          season. On New Year's Day and Epiphany, before sunrise, a little of
          the cake is crumbled with salt and given to the cattle. The rest is
          kept till the day when the cattle are driven out to pasture for the

          corn-spirit is conceived as embodied in an animal; this divine
          animal is slain, and its flesh and blood are partaken of by the
          harvesters. Thus, the cock, the goose, the hare, the cat, the goat,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader has
          probably remarked the complete parallelism between the conceptions
          of the corn-spirit in human and in animal form. The parallel may be
          here briefly resumed. When the corn waves in the wind it is said
          either that the Corn-mother or that the Corn-wolf, etc., is passing
          through the corn. Children are warned against straying in
          corn-fields either because the Corn-mother or because the
          Corn-wolf, etc., is there. In the last corn cut or the last sheaf
          threshed either the Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., is supposed
          to be present. The last sheaf is itself called either the
          Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., and is made up in the shape
          either of a woman or of a wolf, etc. The person who cuts, binds, or
          threshes the last sheaf is called either the Old Woman or the Wolf,
          etc., according to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
          304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the name bestowed on the sheaf itself. As in some places a sheaf
          made in human form and called the Maiden, the Mother of the Maize,
          etc., is kept from one harvest to the next in order to secure a
          continuance of the corn-spirit's blessing; so in some places the
          Harvest-cock and in others the flesh of the goat is kept for a
          similar purpose from one harvest to the next. As in some places the
          grain taken from the Corn-mother is mixed with the seed-corn in
          spring to make the crop abundant; so in some places the feathers of
          the cock, and in Sweden the Yule Boar, are kept till spring and
          mixed with the seed-corn for a like purpose. As part of the
          Corn-mother or Maiden is given to the cattle at Christmas or to the
          horses at the first ploughing, so part of the Yule Boar is given to
          the ploughing horses or oxen in spring. Lastly, the death of the
          corn-spirit is represented by killing or pretending to kill either
          his human or his animal representative; and the worshippers partake
          sacramentally either of the actual body and blood of the
          representative of the divinity, or of bread made in his
          likeness.</p>

              <span style="font-size: 80%">The reason why the corn-spirit is
              thought to take the forms of so many animals may be that wild
              creatures are commonly penned by the advance of the reapers

              as the last refuge of the corn-spirit.</span>

          is asked why the corn-spirit should be thought to appear in the
          form of an animal and of so many different animals, we may reply
          that to primitive man the simple appearance of an animal or bird
          among the corn is probably enough to suggest a mysterious link
          between the creature and the corn; and when we remember that in the
          old days, before fields were fenced in, all kinds of animals must
          have been free to roam over them, we need not wonder that the
          corn-spirit should have been identified even with large animals
          like the horse and cow, which nowadays could not, except by a rare
          accident, be found straying in an English corn-field. This
          explanation applies with peculiar force to the very common case in
          which the animal embodiment of the corn-spirit is believed to lurk
          in the last standing corn. For at harvest a number of wild animals,
          such as hares, rabbits, and partridges, are commonly driven by the
          progress of the reaping into the last patch of standing corn, and
          make their escape from it as it is being cut down. So <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> regularly does this happen that reapers
          and others often stand round the last patch of corn armed with
          sticks or guns, with which they kill the animals as they dart out
          of their last refuge among the stalks. Now, primitive man, to whom
          magical changes of shape seem perfectly credible, finds it most
          natural that the spirit of the corn, driven from his home in the
          ripe grain, should make his escape in the form of the animal which
          is seen to rush out of the last patch of corn as it falls under the
          scythe of the reaper. Thus the identification of the corn-spirit
          with an animal is analogous to the identification of him with a
          passing stranger. As the sudden appearance of a stranger near the
          harvest-field or threshing-floor is, to the primitive mind, enough
          to identify him as the spirit of the corn escaping from the cut or
          threshed corn, so the sudden appearance of an animal issuing from
          the cut corn is enough to identify it with the corn-spirit escaping
          from his ruined home. The two identifications are so analogous that
          they can hardly be dissociated in any attempt to explain them.
          Those who look to some other principle than the one here suggested
          for the explanation of the latter identification are bound to shew
          that their theory covers the former identification also.</p>

        of the Pleiades plays an important part in the calendar of primitive
        peoples, both in the northern and in the southern hemisphere; indeed
        for reasons which at first sight are not obvious savages appear to
        have paid more attention to this constellation than to any other
        group of stars in the sky, and in particular they have commonly timed
        the various operations of the agricultural year by observation of its
        heliacal rising or setting. Some evidence on the subject was adduced
        by the late Dr. Richard Andree,<a id="noteref_994" name="noteref_994"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first place
        it deserves to be noticed that great attention has been paid to the
        Pleiades by savages in the southern hemisphere who do not till the
        ground, and who therefore lack that incentive to observe the stars
        which is possessed by peoples in the agricultural stage of society;
        for we can scarcely doubt that in early ages the practical need of
        ascertaining the proper seasons for sowing and planting has done more
        than mere speculative curiosity to foster a knowledge of astronomy by
        compelling savages to scrutinise the great celestial clock for
        indications of the time of year. Now amongst the rudest of savages
        known to us are the Australian aborigines, none of whom in their
        native state ever practised agriculture. Yet we are told that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“they do, according to their manner, worship
        the hosts of heaven, and believe particular constellations rule
        natural causes. For such they have names, and sing and dance to gain
        the favour of the Pleiades (<span class=

        the constellation worshipped by one body as the giver of rain; but if

        grave doubt, some of the aborigines of New South Wales denied that
        the sun is the source of heat, because he shines also in winter when
        the weather is cold; the real cause of warm weather they held to be
        the Pleiades, because as the summer heat increases, that
        constellation rises higher and higher in the sky, reaching its
        greatest elevation in the height of summer, and gradually sinking
        again in autumn as the days grow cooler, till in winter it is either
        barely visible or lost to view altogether.<a id="noteref_996" name=

        writer, who was well acquainted with the natives of Victoria in the
        early days of the colony and whose testimony can be relied upon,
        tells us that an old chief of the Spring Creek tribe <span class=

        planets and constellations, as indications of the seasons. For
        example, when Canopus is a very little above the horizon in the east
        at daybreak, the season for emu eggs has come; when the Pleiades are
        visible in the east an hour before sunrise, the time for visiting

        nevertheless regarded the Pleiades as an image of their ancestor. As
        that constellation is invisible in the sky of South America for
        several months every year, the Abipones believed that their ancestor
        was then sick, and they were dreadfully afraid that he would die. But

        the return of their ancestor with joyous shouts and the glad music of
        flutes and horns, and they congratulated him on his recovery from

        sleep on the lower branches or perches, and that just as it rises so
        do they; that it brings much cold and rain; that when the

        reappear in June. Their reappearance coincides with the renewal of
        vegetation and of animal life. Hence the legend relates that

        they timed the most solemn and impressive of all their religious
        ceremonies so as to coincide with the moment when that constellation
        was in the middle of the sky at midnight. The ceremony consisted in
        kindling a sacred new fire on the breast of a human victim on the
        last night of a great period of fifty-two years. They expected that
        at the close of one of these periods the stars would cease to revolve
        and the world itself would come to an end. Hence, when the critical
        moment approached, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
        311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        priests watched from the top of a mountain the movement of the stars,
        and especially of the Pleiades, with the utmost anxiety. When that
        constellation was seen to cross the meridian, great was the joy; for
        they knew that the world was respited for another fifty-two years.
        Immediately the bravest and handsomest of the captives was thrown
        down on his back; a board of dry wood was placed on his breast, and
        one of the priests made fire by twirling a stick between his hands on
        the board. As soon as the flame burst forth, the breast of the victim
        was cut open, his heart was torn out, and together with the rest of
        his body was thrown into the fire. Runners carried the new fire at
        full speed to all parts of the kingdom to rekindle the cold hearths;
        for every fire throughout the country had been extinguished as a
        preparation for this solemn rite.<a id="noteref_1014" name=

        many savages apparently see no more, which speaks ill for the
        keenness of their vision; since among ourselves persons endowed with
        unusually good sight are able, I understand, to discern seven. Among
        the Pueblo Indians of Tusayan, an ancient province of Arizona, the
        culmination of the Pleiades is often used to determine the proper
        time for beginning a sacred nocturnal rite, especially an invocation
        addressed to the six deities who are believed to rule the six
        quarters of the world. The writer who records this fact adds:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot explain its significance, and why
        of all stellar objects this minute cluster of stars of a low
        magnitude is more important than other stellar groups is not clear to

        Pueblo Indians see only six stars in the cluster, as to which I
        cannot speak, it might seem to them a reason for assigning one of the
        stars to each of the six quarters, namely, north, south, east, west,

        have seen that ancient Greek farmers reaped their corn when the
        Pleiades rose at sunrise in May, and that they ploughed their fields
        when the constellation set at sunrise in November.<a id=

        interval between the two dates is about six months. Both the Greeks
        and the Romans dated the beginning of summer from the heliacal rising

            <span style="font-size: 80%">The widespread association of the
            Pleiades with agriculture seems to be based on the coincidence of
            their rising or setting with the commencement of the rainy

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So widespread over
        the world has been and is the association of the Pleiades with
        agriculture, especially with the sowing or planting of the crops. The
        reason for the association seems to be the coincidence of the rising
        or setting of the constellation with the commencement of the rainy
        season; since men must very soon have learned that the best, if not
        the only, season to sow and plant is the time of year when the
        newly-planted seeds or roots will be quickened by abundant showers.
        The same association of the Pleiades with rain seems sufficient to
        explain their importance even for savages who do not till the ground;
        for ignorant though such races are, they yet can hardly fail to
        observe that wild fruits grow more plentifully, and therefore that
        they themselves have more to eat after a heavy fall of rain than
        after a long drought. In point of fact we saw that some of the
        Australian aborigines, who are wholly ignorant of agriculture, look
        on the Pleiades as the givers of rain, and curse the constellation if
        its appearance is not followed by the expected showers.<a id=
        "noteref_1059" name="noteref_1059" href="#note_1059"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1059</span></span></a> On the
        other side of the world, and at the opposite end of the scale of
        culture, the civilised Greeks similarly supposed that the autumnal
        setting of the Pleiades was the cause of the rains which followed it;
        and the astronomical writer Geminus thought it worth while to argue
        against the supposition, pointing out that the vicissitudes of the
        weather and of the seasons, though they may coincide with the risings
        and settings of the constellations, are not produced by them,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319"
        id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the stars being too distant
        from the earth to exercise any appreciable influence on our
        atmosphere. Hence, he says, though the constellations serve as the
        signals, they must not be regarded as the causes, of atmospheric
        changes; and he aptly illustrates the distinction by a reference to
        beacon-fires, which are the signals, but not the causes, of
        war.<a id="noteref_1060" name="noteref_1060" href=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The festivals of Dionysus were
          biennial in many places. See G. F. Schömann, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Griechische
          Alterthümer</span></span>,<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          (The terms for the festival were τριετηρίς, τριετηρικός, both terms
          of the series being included in the numeration, in accordance with
          the ancient mode of reckoning.) Perhaps the festivals were formerly
          annual and the period was afterwards lengthened, as has happened
          with other festivals. See W. Mannhardt, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          of Dionysus, however, were annual. Dr. Farnell has conjectured that
          the biennial period in many Greek festivals is to be explained by
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the original shifting of land-cultivation
          which is frequent in early society owing to the backwardness of the
          agricultural processes; and which would certainly be consecrated by
          a special ritual attached to the god of the soil.”</span> See L. R.

          that Demeter was originally a personification of the earth regarded
          as divine, but he admitted that from the time of the Homeric poems
          downwards she was sharply distinguished from Ge, the earth-goddess
          proper. See Daremberg et Saglio, <span class=

          Some light might be thrown on the question whether Demeter was an
          Earth Goddess or a Corn Goddess, if we could be sure of the
          etymology of her name, which has been variously explained as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Earth Mother”</span> (Δῆ μήτηρ equivalent
          to Γῆ μήτηρ) and as <span class="tei tei-q">“Barley Mother”</span>
          (from an alleged Cretan word δηαί <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“barley”</span>: see <span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>).
          The former etymology has been the most popular; the latter is
          maintained by W. Mannhardt. See L. Preller, <span class=

          open to serious philological objections, and that no satisfactory
          derivation of the first syllable of Demeter's name has yet been
          proposed. Accordingly I prefer to base no argument on an analysis
          of the name, and to rest my interpretation of the goddess entirely
          on her myth, ritual, and representations in art. Etymology is at
          the best a very slippery ground on which to rear mythological
          theories.</dd>

          much trumpeting set out in enormous bands on their southward
          journey to the tropical regions of Africa and India. In early

          The inscriptions prove that the Proerosia was held at Eleusis and
          that it was distinct from the Great Mysteries, being mentioned
          separately from them. Some of the ancients accounted for the origin
          of the festival by a universal plague instead of a universal
          famine. But this version of the story no doubt arose from the
          common confusion between the similar Greek words for plague and
          famine (λοιμός and λιμός). That in the original version famine and
          not plague must have been alleged as the reason for instituting the
          Proerosia, appears plainly from the reference of the name to
          ploughing, from the dedication of the festival to Demeter, and from
          the offerings of first-fruits; for these circumstances, though
          quite appropriate to ceremonies designed to stay or avert dearth
          and famine, would be quite inappropriate in the case of a

          ch. 48), was no doubt told to explain the use of torches in the
          mysteries of Demeter and Persephone. The author of the Homeric
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hymn to
          Demeter</span></span> tells us (verses 47 <span class=

          that Demeter searched for her lost daughter for nine days with
          burning torches in her hands, but he does not say that the torches
          were kindled at the flames of Etna. In art Demeter and Persephone
          and their attendants were often represented with torches in their
          hands. See L. R. Farnell, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          This interpretation accords perfectly with a well-attested sense of

          Δελφῶν. By coupling μυστηρίοις with ἀπάρχεσθαι instead of with
          κελεύετω, Miss J. E. Harrison understands the offering instead of
          the exhortation to have been made at the mysteries (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prolegomena to the
          Study of Greek Religion</span></span>, Second Edition, p. 155,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Let the Hierophant and the Torchbearer
          command that at the mysteries the Hellenes should offer
          first-fruits of their crops,”</span> etc.). This interpretation is
          no doubt grammatically permissible, but the context seems to plead
          strongly, if not to be absolutely decisive, in favour of the other.
          It is to be observed that the exhortation was addressed not to the
          Athenians and their allies (who were compelled to make the
          offering) but only to the other Greeks, who might make it or not as
          they pleased; and the amount of such voluntary contributions was
          probably small compared to that of the compulsory contributions, as
          to the date of which nothing is said. That the proclamation to the
          Greeks in general was an exhortation (κελευέτω), not a command, is
          clearly shewn by the words of the decree a few lines lower down,
          where commissioners are directed to go to all Greek states
          exhorting but not commanding them to offer the first-fruits
          (ἐκείνοις δὲ μὴ ἐπιτάττοντας, κελεύοντας δὲ ἀπάρχεσθαι ἐὰν
          βούλωνται κατὰ τὰ πάτρια καὶ τὴν μαντείαν ἐγ Δελφῶν). The Athenians
          could not command free and independent states to make such
          offerings, still less could they prescribe the exact date when the
          offerings were to be made. All that they could and did do was,
          taking advantage of the great assembly of Greeks from all quarters
          at the mysteries, to invite or exhort, by the mouth of the great
          priestly functionaries, the foreigners to contribute.</dd>

          the midst of a heap of dung, buried as high as the neck, a little

          regarded this statue with a very high degree of superstitious
          veneration. They attributed to its presence the fertility of their
          land; and it was for this reason that they heaped around it the
          manure intended for their fields. They believed that the loss of it
          would be followed by no less a calamity than the failure of their
          annual harvests; and they pointed to the ears of bearded wheat,
          upon the sculptured ornaments upon the head of the figure, as a
          never-failing indication of the produce of the soil.”</span> When
          the statue was about to be removed, a general murmur ran among the

          if the inarticulate artist were aware of their original identity of
          substance. And even among the monuments of the transitional period
          it is difficult to find any representation of the goddesses in
          characters at once clear and impressive. We miss this even in the
          beautiful vase of Hieron in the British Museum, where the divine
          pair are seen with Triptolemos: the style is delicate and stately,
          and there is a certain impression of inner tranquil life in the

          give the impression that the numismatic artists of this period were
          always careful to distinguish—in such a manner as the above works
          indicate—between mother and daughter. The old idea of their unity
          of substance still seemed to linger as an art-tradition: the very
          type we have just been examining appears on a fourth-century coin
          of Hermione, and must have been used here to designate Demeter
          Chthonia who was there the only form that the corn-goddess assumed.
          And even at Metapontum, where coin-engraving was long a great art,
          a youthful head crowned with corn, which in its own right and on
          account of its resemblance to the masterpiece of Euainetos could
          claim the name of Kore [Persephone], is actually inscribed

          of ancient religious art, which seems to represent Demeter giving
          the corn-stalks to Triptolemus, while Persephone crowns his head,

          However, the Eleusinian Torchbearer Callias apparently claimed to
          be descended from Triptolemus, for in a speech addressed to the
          Lacedaemonians he is said by Xenophon (<span class=

          spoken of Triptolemus as <span class="tei tei-q">“our

          "#Pg054" class="tei tei-ref">54</a>. But it is possible that
          Callias was here speaking, not as a direct descendant of
          Triptolemus, but merely as an Athenian, who naturally ranked
          Triptolemus among the most illustrious of the ancestral heroes of
          his people. Even if he intended to claim actual descent from the
          hero, this would prove nothing as to the historical character of
          Triptolemus, for many Greek families boasted of being descended
          from gods.</dd>

          Cat's cradle is played as a game by savages in many parts of the
          world, including the Torres Straits Islands, the Andaman Islands,
          Africa, and America. See A. C. Haddon, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Study of
          Man</span></span> (London and New York, 1898), pp. 224-232; Miss
          Kathleen Haddon, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cat's Cradles from Many Lands</span></span>
          (London, 1911). For example, the Indians of North-western Brazil
          play many games of cat's cradle, each of which has its special
          name, such as the Bow, the Moon, the Pleiades, the Armadillo, the
          Spider, the Caterpillar, and the Guts of the Tapir. See Th.
          Koch-Grünberg, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          (Berlin, 1909-1910), i. 120, 123, 252, 253, ii. 127, 131. Finding
          the game played as a magical rite to stay the sun or promote the
          growth of the crops among peoples so distant from each other as the
          Esquimaux and the natives of New Guinea, we may reasonably surmise
          that it has been put to similar uses by many other peoples, though
          civilised observers have commonly seen in it nothing more than a
          pastime. Probably many games have thus originated in magical rites.
          When their old serious meaning was forgotten, they continued to be
          practised simply for the amusement they afforded the players.
          Another such game seems to be the <span class="tei tei-q">“Tug of

          village.... Those which are of regular occurrence are for the most
          part connected with the crops. Even where irrigated terraces are
          made, the rice plant is much affected by deficiencies of rain and
          excess of sun. Before the crop is sown, the village is tabu or
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">genna</span></span>. The gates are closed and
          the friend without has to stay outside, while the stranger that is
          within the gates remains till all is ended. The festival is marked
          among some tribes by an outburst of licentiousness, for, so long as
          the crops remain ungarnered, the slightest incontinence might ruin
          all. An omen of the prosperity of the crops is taken by a mock
          contest, the girls pulling against the men. In some villages the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gennas</span></span> last for ten days, but
          the tenth day is the crowning day of all. The men cook, and eat
          apart from the women during this time, and the food tabus are
          strictly enforced. From the conclusion of the initial crop
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">genna</span></span> to the commencement of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">genna</span></span> which ushers in the
          harvest-time, all trade, all fishing, all hunting, all cutting
          grass and felling trees is forbidden. Those tribes which specialise
          in cloth-weaving, salt-making or pottery-making are forbidden the
          exercise of these minor but valuable industries. Drums and bugles
          are silent all the while.... Between the initial crop <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">genna</span></span> and the harvest-home, some
          tribes interpose a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">genna</span></span> day which depends on the
          appearance of the first blade of rice. All celebrate the
          commencement of the gathering of the crops by a <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">genna</span></span>, which lasts at least two
          days. It is mainly a repetition of the initial <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">genna</span></span> and, just as the first
          seed was sown by the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          the village, so he is obliged to cut the first ear of rice before
          any one else may begin.”</span> On such occasions among the Kabuis,
          in spite of the licence accorded to the people generally, the
          strictest chastity is required of the religious head of the village
          who initiates the sowing and the reaping, and his diet is extremely
          limited; for example, he may not eat dogs or tomatoes. See T. C.

          The resemblance of some of these customs to those of the Kayans of
          Borneo is obvious. We may conjecture that the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“tug of war”</span> which takes place between the sexes
          on several of these Sabbaths was originally a magical ceremony to
          ensure good crops rather than merely a mode of divination to
          forecast the coming harvest. Magic regularly dwindles into
          divination before it degenerates into a simple game. At one of
          these taboo periods the men set up an effigy of a man and throw
          pointed bamboos at it. He who hits the figure in the head will kill
          an enemy; he who hits it in the belly will have plenty of food. See

          associated with the rites of Dionysus rather than of Demeter;
          perhaps the sound of it was thought to mimick the bellowing of the
          god in his character of a bull. But the worship of Dionysus was
          from an early time associated with that of Demeter in the
          Eleusinian mysteries; and the god himself, as we have seen, had
          agricultural affinities. See above, p. <a href="#Pg005" class=

          Mr. Hugh E. Cameron, formerly of Glen Moriston, Inverness-shire,
          wrote to me many years ago: <span class="tei tei-q">“As a boy, I
          remember the last bit of corn cut was taken home, and neatly tied
          up with a ribbon, and then stuck up on the wall above the kitchen
          fire-place, and there it often remained till the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘maiden’</span> of the following year took its place.
          There was no ceremony about it, beyond often a struggle as to who
          would get, or cut, the last sheaf to select the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘maiden’</span> from”</span> (<span class=

          As to Sutherlandshire my mother was told by a servant, Isabella
          Ross, that in that county <span class="tei tei-q">“they hang up the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘maiden’</span> generally over the
          mantel-piece (chimney-piece) till the next harvest. They have
          always a kirn, whipped cream, with often a ring in it, and
          sometimes meal sprinkled over it. The girls must all be dressed in
          lilac prints, they all dance, and at twelve o'clock they eat
          potatoes and herrings”</span> (<span class=

          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Zaramamas</span></span>) are of three sorts,
          namely (1) those which are made of maize stalks, dressed up like
          women, (2) those which are carved of stone in the likeness of cobs
          of maize, and (3) those which consist simply of fruitful stalks of
          maize or of two maize-cobs naturally joined together. These last,
          the writer tells us, were the principal <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Zaramamas</span></span>, and were revered by
          the natives as Mothers of the Maize. Similarly, when two potatoes
          were found growing together the Indians called them Potato-mothers
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Axomamas</span></span>) and kept them in order
          to get a good crop of potatoes. As Arriaga's work is rare, it may
          be well to give his account of the Maize-mothers, Coca-mothers, and
          Potato-mothers in his own words. He says (p. 16): <span class=

          y entienden, que como madre tiene virtud de engendrar, y parir

          are the occasions when the Indians brought forth their idols and
          other relics of superstition and delivered them to the
          ecclesiastical visitors. At Tarija in Bolivia, down to the present
          time, a cross is set up at harvest in the maize-fields, and on it
          all maize-spadices growing as twins are hung. They are called
          Pachamamas (Earth-mothers) and are thought to bring good harvests.

          This essay (pp. 361-411) contains a valuable collection of facts
          relating to what the writer calls the Rice-mother in the East
          Indies. But it is to be observed that while all the Indonesian
          peoples seem to treat a certain portion of the rice at harvest with
          superstitious respect and ceremony, only a part of them actually
          call it <span class="tei tei-q">“the Rice-mother.”</span> Mr. Kruyt
          prefers to speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“soul-stuff”</span>
          rather than of <span class="tei tei-q">“a soul,”</span> because,
          according to him, in living beings the animating principle is
          conceived, not as a tiny being confined to a single part of the
          body, but as a sort of fluid or ether diffused through every part
          of the body. See his work, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          330-337. The writer dates his article from Tanneteya (in Celebes?),
          but otherwise gives no indication of the geographical position of
          the people he describes. A similar omission is common with Dutch
          writers on the geography and ethnology of the East Indies, who too
          often appear to assume that the uncouth names of these barbarous
          tribes and obscure hamlets are as familiar to European readers as
          Amsterdam or the Hague. The Toerateyas whose customs Mr. Maan
          describes in this article are the inland inhabitants of Celebes.
          Their name Toerateyas or Toradjas signifies simply <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“inlanders”</span> and is applied to them by their
          neighbours who live nearer the sea; it is not a name used by the
          people themselves. The Toradjas include many tribes and the
          particular tribe whose usages in regard to the Rice-mother are
          described in the text is probably not one of those whose customs
          and beliefs have been described by Mr. A. C. Kruijt in many
          valuable papers. See above, p. 183 note 1, and <span class=

          It seems to shew that in the Central Provinces the last corn is
          left standing on the field as a portion for the corn-spirit, and
          that he is believed to be immanent in it; hence the name of

          for the purpose of collecting wood took place on the morning of the
          sacrifice. Another description of the sacrifice is given by Mr. G.

          According to this last account the victim was shot with arrows and
          afterwards burnt. Before the body was consumed in the fire a man
          pulled out the arrows, cut open the breast of the victim, and
          having smeared his face with the blood ran away as fast as he

          corn-goddess Ceres, celebrated on the nineteenth of April, foxes
          were allowed to run about with burning torches tied to their tails,
          and the custom was explained as a punishment inflicted on foxes
          because a fox had once in this way burned down the crops (Ovid,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Fasti</span></span>, iv. 679 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>).
          Samson is said to have burned the crops of the Philistines in a
          similar fashion (Judges xv. 4 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>). Whether the custom and the
          tradition are connected with the idea of the fox as an embodiment
          of the corn-spirit is doubtful. Compare W. Mannhardt, <span class=

          the Legislative Council of Victoria in 1858; from which we may
          perhaps infer that his statement refers especially to the tribes of
          Victoria or at all events of south-eastern Australia. It seems to
          be a common belief among the aborigines of central and
          south-eastern Australia that the Pleiades are women who once lived
          on earth but afterwards went up into the sky. See W. E. Stanbridge,

          Some tribes of Victoria believed that the Pleiades were originally
          a queen and six of her attendants, but that the Crow (Waa) fell in
          love with the queen and ran away with her, and that since then the
          Pleiades have been only six in number. See James Dawson,

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
